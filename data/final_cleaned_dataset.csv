US,"I registered on the website, tried to order a laptop, entered all the details, but instead of charging me and sending the product, they froze my account, demanding various verification documents. I sent them over. They said they would review them within 24 hours. In reality, it's been a week, and no one can help or give any (truthful) estimate of when it will be resolved; they just tell me to 'wait.' I've never seen such a horrible marketplace in my life.

AU,I have bought from Amazon before and no problems being very happy with the service and price. Amazon advertise the product at 61.23 us as soon as I logged in and tried to buy two of the items they were 86.75 for each.There is no way of contacting customer service I've spent an hour going round and round in circles. Very disappointing. I would leave a negative star review for the customer service and what I consider to be really poor advertising. ,2024,9,September,2024,5,1,0,Other
GB,If I could give a lower rate I would! I cancelled my Amazon Prime in February and subsequently found that they had continued to charge me.

My last missing order actually says the driver handed it to the resident. I live alone and was at work at the time of the delivery. They insisted that I need to wait another 24 hours to see if it mysteriously shows up. If it was still coming why do I have a tracking that says the delivery was handed to me? They are also very inconsistent with delivery times. When you call customer service they just don't care. This company is not standing behind its products or deliveries.

I placed an order for a 16"" duct, which was crucial for one of our ongoing projects. The order came with a guaranteed delivery date that Amazon failed to meet. After several unsuccessful attempts to reach Amazon (with no accessible customer service contact numbers or direct support options), I was forced to contact the third-party seller directly. The seller assured me that the product had been dispatched on time and advised me to resolve the issue with Amazon. Despite being provided with a phone number that I could not find anywhere on Amazon’s platform, I eventually managed to speak with an Amazon representative. I was informed that the product had been lost, and while a refund was issued, the real issue remains unresolved.I need the material, not just a refund. When I attempted to reorder the product, I discovered that the price had increased by $150 — an unjustifiable increase given the circumstances. I explained the situation to the representative, emphasizing that I had already quoted my customer the original price and could not go back to them with an unexplained price hike. In summary, my experience with Amazon has been one of misleading pricing, unreliable delivery, and a lack of customer support. This has caused significant delays for my business and damaged my relationship with my customer.I expect Amazon to resolve this by honoring the original price and ensuring the prompt delivery of the product.Sincerely,  Alex Garcia  Attic Crawl Inc.",2024,9,September,2024,3,1,0,US

US,"I returned a product using my Amazon Prime card, product was return and a refund should have been issued to my Prime Card, but no they went and issued me a gift card without any notification through mail, email or account. Never sent me a code or card in case I wanted to use my funds to my balance. What kind of service is that. If I would have used my bank card or any other credit card how would have my funds been returned? I went to make a quick purchase again using my prime card and the site went using my gift card without giving me an option on my card. Now that I innocently used the gift card they don’t want to send me a gift card or apply remaining balance to my account where it should have been placed from beginning. How unprofessional and frustrating this is when any time there is a return it is to be given back to the card used not how ever they chose. If I would have paid cash then yes I can understand a gift card but NO CASH WAS USED. I want my funds added to my account or a gift card sent out that can be used to make payment to my card.

IN,Amazon india the worst customer service company compared to amazon anywhere else in the world. Agents are bloody third class idiat. They know nothing and they will waste ur time understanding ur problem. Amazon india is selling duplicate products. They dont offer hassle free refunds. I purchased a table fountain from themAnd the day i opened the box it was defective. They agreed to pick up the unit the next day. As expected they did not and when contacted they put a status that customer refused to the deliver the product. Just see these idiat. Then when i contacted them they said investigation is on and it will take another 4 days to resolve the issue. After 4 days when in contacted these rascals they are saying that their investigation is complete and nothing is wrong and they cannot helpWith the refund. What should i say now? Just see their bloody service. They should be taken to court for cheating and fraud moral of the story do not i repeat do not buy expensive products from amazon better go to a showroom and get one u can feel touch and get a view of the unit and decide.

US,"I bought outdoor water timers for garden and yard from Amazon, and the cheaper foreign brands have failed. So did many of my plants. I read the manuals and they say that the maximum operating temperature is less than 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Amazon wouldn't refund my money, I reached them by phone and told them that Amazon needed to discontinue selling products that are not rated to be used in regions that experience higher temperatures than stated in product manuals. This is going to be a huge problem in the future, plastics, electronics and other temperature sensitive outdoor products will degrade or stop working and retailers should make operating temperatures a basic factor in choosing products to sell to consumers. In 2024 Phoenix, Arizona had 64 days when temperatures were 110 or above. Lawnmowers, outdoor equipment, hoses, lawn furniture and other products will have to be modified to withstand higher temperatures or they are going to fail or wear out much sooner than in the past.

The photos of the delivery are not even of my property or that of the other house with the same number.  im sure the drivers have stock photos..

The 2 nearest lockers are in the Co-op shops that close at 9.00pm. This can be difficult to do when you work shifts.  Basically my complaint is the delivery drivers need to take more care.

That became less-so when they continued to send me items which were used/returned, BROKEN (literally), leaking, non-working, and just plain THE WRONG ITEM!  Still, I shopped them for the convenience, the pricing, and because I did purchase some items which I very much liked and thought of as good buys.  TODAY, however, I received a HUGE multi-cooker / air-fryer POT instead of the DUAL-basket, windowed air-fryer I actually purchased.  But, that's not all.  When I phoned Amazon, they asked me for a copy of my IDENTIFICATION in order to process a return and refund.  Whaaaaat?  You mean to tell me that in their utter incompetence, THEY send me crappy items and THEN they want to RANSOM my refund because (maybe?) they think I am trying to put myself through the hassle and frustration of dealing with a return????  HOW absurd is that?  OH, and more so because the Air Fryer I actually ordered and was expecting, is CHEAPER than the multi-cooker pot thing they sent me.  Soooo, what is the angle in regard to this refund that would require my ID so as to return a MORE EXPENSIVE item?  /facedesk  ... I literally loathe this company now, and hope that something comes along quickly that can upend them and show them how it's done.  I know that's a pipedream, however, because think of it:  Bezos is using ALL this money that POURS in daily, to INVEST.  Those returns on investment make him RICH.

US,"Yesterday, I received the most random email from my inquisition friends over at Amazon's crooked ""account specialist"" team, who are literally dredging up old disputes from last year to try and recharge for them. It just so happens that UPS only keeps tracking records for 120 days. Well Amazon is trying to collect on a dispute that my bank closed-out in my favor about 456 days later. Their account specialist randomly acted like it was a new dispute, even though it's from more than a year ago. I haven't made any returns for the last seven months, and recently made two returns, so I think Amazon is trying to retaliate against me for no reason other than that this is their latest maneuver to try and goad me into rethinking legitimate returns.Background on Dispute: This item was confirmed through UPS back then as having arrived at an Amazon facility. Amazon resisted against refunding me, citing that the item never arrived, contrary to clear evidence at the time. Chase Bank resolved things in my favor after I produced all the evidence. I have none of it on hand anymore, as this was a closed matter in my eyes, especially 456 days after the fact.I have filed complaints with the FTC, the BBB, and am working on a state attorney general complaint, after Amazon sends over my request archive of data. I am not going to allow a billion dollar company to bully me over a $16.91 dispute. The sheer pettiness of it, but if Amazon is doing this to multiple consumers, and many of us are subconsciously reconsidering making returns or accepting losses for defective items or Amazon's mishandling of a return, then Amazon is winning in trying to minimize the number of returns in the most odious way possible.",2024,9,September,2024,1,1,0,US

GB,No problem ordering from Amazon. They make the process simple and its quick and effective. However the delivering of goods is ridiculous. I have had 2 deliveries in the past 2 days. I physically watched the driver leave his van and walk up the path. He could not see me. I waited for the door to go but nothing happened although i did see the colour of the delivery guys jacket heading back down the close stairs. I assumed it must have been a delivery for next door and thought no more of it for 5 minutes. Then my phone went to tell me my package was delivered!!!! News to me so I opened the door and in the middle of my step was my package. The driver made no attempt to ring the bell or knock the door and the same thing happened with yesterdays delivery.If this happens again the item will be returned to amazon for a full refund as i am not in the habit of buying things with a huge risk attached on whetheri receive it or not.I called amazon customer services who were more interested in getting me to jump through hoops than help. After doing all the account verification before speaking to the advisor she was unwilling to help unless i went through all the security again. Pathetic.

GB,"I've been loyally using Amazon for around ten years now, but my experience with it in 2024, especially within the last two or three months, has been absolutely dreadful. The two most common complaints I have to give, and the most annoying -1. Orders being delayed or outright being lost. I had an order that was out for delivery, then it kept being delayed until I was told it would arrive by 10pm, then it was delayed by two days, and the same thing just happened but this time delayed by four days. How can an order be OUT FOR DELIVERY and then end up being delayed by days?2. The refund system. I was told by an automated service that I'd be refunded for said cases above, but the system then told me I'd be refunded once the items are returned. I contacted one of the agents and questioned how can I return something that didn't arrive, and thankfully they agreed and refunded me. I don't know what's changed internally, but Amazon used to have reliable delivery and a reliable refund system. In the past months it's just completely gone downhill. I won't be using them from here on out. Do yourself a favour and use one of the many alternatives that now exist, there are plenty of great websites out there that are currently much better.

I've never given anything but accurate honest reviews and if you're going to start silencing customers I'm filing a complaint with BBB and letting everyone on social media know. Postmaster showed me the labels they use are created on Photoshop and then customer has to pay $12.43 for shipping cause the seller didn't pay the postage. The postmaster contacted the authorities because what the vendor is doing is a FEDERAL OFFENSE. NOT TO MENTION, I never ordered a 2nd pair and they not only charged me for them but then I had to pay postage. Same thing happened with 1st order. I returned those and only. Got back something like $12 which didn't even cover the postage. You need to stop silencing customers who have valid warnings and only. Post truthful reviews. I will not take the horrible way you've been treating me, freezing my account and now removed every review i ever posted plus I'll never be allowed to post a review again. I'm filing a complaint with BBB because your reasoning is unfounded and If I need to I will file a lawsuit for discrimination.

A third party where a family member resides in Florida about 2 months ago as a favor purchased 2 items I had asked my son to purchase for me. I sent the Photographs so he would know what items they were. I didn’t have knowledge that they would both be purchased at Amazon. They were a Tough Light 400 and an Eton Emergency Radio. I only know that my son indicated that the lamp was double the price advertised, no issue with the price of the Eton Radio. The items were carefully packaged with Bubble wrap and foam and mailed to me in Puerto Rico. Upon arrival, the Tough Light 400 although it looked perfect never turned on. I followed the advice of the manufacturer and nothing worked. The radio was operating well, however I noticed that there were scuff marks on one side and the screw where the Lithium battery was looked like it had been tampered with. I called Amazon first since I didn’t have a receipt or the address where the products were shipped to. Amazon immediately responded that I had to have proof of purchase to return and that after 30 days I needed to take the issue to the manufacture. Tough Light never responded to a message I left them and after sending an email expressing the diverse issues, there position was that in order to return and replace I needed to have proof of purchase. I know that every product sold has a unique number and ToughLight could have easily verified if the product I have was sold through Amazon m. That ended the story! However, the Eton Radio was not charging properly solar or with furnished plug to charge in an electrical outlet. The response was 180 degrees from Amazon and ToughLight! I explained the predicament I was in; not having proof of purchase and not acquainted with the person who purchased the products. People are reluctant to furnish credit card information to a person they don’t know, but I am very grateful for the gesture regardless. Eton, simply requested my address and committed to sending a shipping label. After they receive the Radio, they will send a new product. Therefore, my first experience with Amazon and last… I don’t have an exact date, however I do know the products were purchased and sent to me about a few weeks afterwards.

After hiring an attorney to appeal to Amazon's legal team, Amazon responded that selling Marshmallow Leaf on their website is fatal to reinstatement of the accounts, even though a quick search on their marketplace reveals that plenty of sellers are still selling products that contain Marshmallow Leaf. This unfair treatment of our businesses reveals that Amazon is clearly in support of addictive substances such as nicotine-filled tobacco cigarettes, and is also in favor of destroying family owned businesses to maintain their dominance of the online retail marketplace.

Further aggravating the situation is the unhelpful customer service that provides no meaningful guidance on correcting the supposed issues with my reviews.Despite my appreciation for the value of the products I purchased, the deficient and opaque review process, coupled with a customer service team that gives no definitive answers, has led me to the point of exasperation.

It was on a price offer until midnight and would be delivered the next day (today).  I just happened to look at my orders and saw that it would, now, not be delivered for another TWENTY FOUR DAYS.  On the order page, I clicked on the image of the item - read that again slowly, ON THE  ORDER  PAGE,  I  CLICKED  ON  THE  IMAGE  OF  THE  ITEM  and it took me back to it, SHOWING THAT I HAD BOUGHT IT THE DAY BEFORE but it was now back to its original price AND WITH NEXT DAY DELIVERY.  I called amazon to query this and was told that I could cancel the order re-place it and my item would arrive the next day.  But, of course, I would have to pay the higher price.  No amount of arguing seemed to be able to answer the question of how EXACTLY the same item can be delivered next day at the higher price, but at the offer price I paid the previous day I would have to wait over three weeks.  Insanity.  I demanded to speak to the agent's supervisor and, after more arguing, I was put through.  The supervisor, after more arguing and trying to get through to him the ridiculousness of the situation, was magnanimous enough to offer me the difference in a gift card if I cancelled and re-placed the order.

I understand that that's part of mail-ordering... but there's always somethings that are ""hinky"" about the delays. For instance, I received a confirmation 20 hours ago that the items had just shipped and that I could expect them today. Just now, I received a delay notice that it ""should"" arrive in 5 days. (How did it get delayed overnight?) And the other delays were similarly nonsensical.I've worked in shipping & receiving positions a lot, in my career days, so I get that odd things can happen, in fact odd can be rather normal in the ""business"". So, I'm unconvinced that the reasons behind any of my recent delayed shipments were the ""normal sort of odd"".The thing with Amazon and their sellers is that there's a rather long waiting period when an item gets delayed before they'll consider it lost and grant a refund or whatever. Also, they don't take the loss/delay seriously like they used to do back in the day. And to add to that, there's really no place on the Amazon site to comment about their site (as if they care about the customer) ... I've always hated looking at the reviews about an item, only to read about shipping issues... now I understand why.So, a month or so ago, I quit Amazon Prime because paying for better shipping privileges when the shipping services were cruddy didn't make sense.

Yes they put there msny cheap products to cheat you, make you they are cheap, but less them 5% of their catalogue have a good price just to cheat you, all orders products can be 100x times cheaper everywhere! Open the eyes! They have debited my cards so many times without my permission, I considered if I don't checked I will be stolen, they don't have shame to do that? In Amazon this is normal for them. And for example delivery time? They say you will be refunded if item don't arrives in time, them when time arrives, they say you need await more 3 days them 1 week, them only after that you can ask refund?? What are a cheaters, liars? And they duplicate my orders, oh my god this is number one website of scamners, and also their website it's only well made, it's full of errors, bugs, looks a shop by children's nothing there makes sense.

GB,"As a market place Amazon is very easy to use. However fake reviews abound and there are a lot of scams, some obvious, which they don't seem too keen to root out - for example: any number of SD cards which trick your computer or phone into thinking it has a terabyte or even more of extra memory but really only has a fraction of that, and which corrupt your files when the real limit is reached. I decided to part company with Amazon when their customer service department contradicted itself, claiming that my account could not be restored when just the previous evening someone from the accounts department had been on the verge of doing precisely that, lacking only immediate access to my email for verification (unfortunately I was away from my computer at the time). I was told I now needed to set up a new account, but in doing so I now stand to lose several years of accumulated Kindle books. On account of this dire, confused and unhelpful customer service and the prevalence of scams and fakery I can only rate Amazon at 2 stars even though you can buy anything there and the app is easy to use. Many I am sure would have only given it one star.",2024,9,September,2024,1,2,0,GB

US,"Sell used products and has horrible customer service, i just to be a prime member but i live in a rural area, so I just wasn’t getting my items any faster then what i would not paying…. I have a few experiences LAST YEAR: I do Christmas shopping early, and I homeschool so my kids are with me all the time and well i thought Amazon would be convenient source. Upon going through my packages, i had noticed i was sold used boys underwear, I usually use the chat option and the girl started to interrogate me and said i had to send a photo of my license, i was like no, so i called instantly and I got this girl and she said no, and “supposedly” gave me 50 promo to repurchase the underwear, well…. It never got added to my account, never i went through associate after associate, one in which screamed so loudly at me and blamed me of lying and then hung up, finally i got this girl who said i had used it, so I asked her on what she goes a toolbox for a back of a truck it was used in part of that order, i assured her that i indeed did not own a truck…. And that my account must of been hacked, i got through associate after associate, nothing was done at all, in fact the Hanes company themselves refunded me for the underwear sent me replacements, i did get a call from there higher up office and they have me a $50 gift balance, well ok it gets even better, i get my son a gaming laptop $800, the seller was very unreasonable, the associate promised it was A-Z well needless to say we had to send this laptop out and have if fixed $400 in extra damages, finally after i complained so much they wrote us a letter to dispute he charges on our card, after that i bought some leggings, there was a whole in the leggings, the associate said I must of been so heavy i stretched them out and i could not get a refund.  Half of the items i got last year were either not as described by the sellers or just used and retaped back up and sold as new. Then they sold me a pairs of winter boots, and there was white power all over them i complained about those too….i sent items back and didn’t get a return they kept it numerous times, i had to involve the bbb to get anywheres Well this year i decided nope no way am i going to deal with Amazon, well i found a wahl clipper set i paid $200 for this set, it took a gouge of skin out of my husbands head, amazon refused to refund me because i was one day over the deadline. I had to go to bbb for that i just sent it back and finally they did refund me after a fight, but they wanted me to contact the company,So i decided well I’m going to go to Walmart for know on they have all the same items and it will be much easier to return if necessary, but with dread a few items Walmart did not have so I had to purchase with Amazon, i ordered a camera bundle for 141.58 it came with accessories, well upon opening my back there’s no accessories, so well i thought ill deal with the seller, usually there earlier they will just send what’s missing, i talk to the seller and he’s just unreasonable, saying he can’t send it because it will cost him money. Like no reason at all, well with complete dread i chat with amazon and speak with an agent named Joey Mae, he was polite and gave me two options 1. I return for a replacement, or 2, they give me half a refund to my original payment method. I chose option 2, he said id get a email…… well waiting no email, then another agents said the same thing, no email, then the 3rd said they approved it and ill be getting back 64.58 and i should get a email. I got a email there like return it for 141.58 for a full refund and you’ll have to repurchase the item, so i wrote back and said there must be a mistake and told them and shared the screenshots i took, because i had one to many ptsd experiences, there like no we have to take this to a higher level. So i called and got this English lady who screams at me has me on hold for 20mins and just comes back yelling. I wrote to the highest up, and they still didn’t budge even with the screen shots as proof, so i took it to the bbb, and still will not budge, so I’m out 141.58. Also they sold me toy in the same order that was used and the amount of dust on it was so thick you could write your name in it, and it was stabbed repeated over and over again with something sharp, i was able to send photos of that and they replaced that and told me to keep and donate the other one.They changed there return policy around know they use a QR code and you take your item to the ups store and they scan it do all the packaging, I live in a rural area, the nearest ups store is 2 hours away, and you have to pay $7.99 to print your own label, and $14.99 to have ups pick up at your door. We have little ups mailbox at a gas station but it’s for small items. They rob ppl, I’m going to write them with intent to sue unless they give me my refund, I’ve had it, and they don’t even give you a full refund when you return items.

US,"The deliberate sale of defective merchandise, accompanied by an effort to shifting the burden of responsibility onto the purchaser is a criminal offense, this constitutes a fraudulent business practice. This scenario involves third-party sellers dispatching damaged products to buyers while the principal company, and Amazon is known foe its fraudulent business practices, it's  imperative that such entities are held accountable for their deceptive conduct, and consumers should be wary of engaging with companies that employ these unethical strategies. The liability for the defect and the associated return costs should unequivocally fall upon the seller or platform, not the buyer and as a buyer you have the right to refuse any  liability that's associated with afraudulent business practice and stop patronizing AMAZON until their policy is revised in consideration of all consumer laws and must benefit your interest as a consumer.Your foreign representatives are extremely disrespectful and unprofessional.

CA,"   Amazon customer service has sunk to new depths.  It seems the general approach is to throw out random explanations, no matter how untrue,  and hope one of them sticks.  Writing to executives is not helpful, as they just throw your issue to some Executive Response team, manned by the same low competence.    My issue stems from a google play gift card order via Amazon for an important birthday.  Two days after the order was accepted, and on the day the gift card was due to be delivered, it was arbitrarily cancelled.    The following saga ensues as I repeatedly contact customer service with two simple questions:  Why was the order cancelled and who cancelled it-  Agent says it was damaged in transit .... it’s an electronic gift card -  Same agent says I cancelled the order .... this is not the case -  Same agent says they can’t track anything as the order is over 30 days old .... the order was placed 5 days earlier -  The supervisor can’t figure out what happened and promises a response within 48 hours .... no response was ever received -  I escalate to CS-escalation and am told “not our problem, talk to the marketplace vendor for a refund.” ... refund was not the issue -  I escalate up the executive chain and i receive a response saying the payment was rejected by my bank.   I proceed to demonstrate that payment was in fact taken but reimbursed two days later  ... so not a rejection from the bank -  A different agent agrees that it was not a payment rejection and promises a response by Aug 20 ... I receive a response Aug 22-  The response states “an error on our end processing this refund” ... refund was not the issue  In short, terrible customer service and executives who don’t care about your experience.   Amazon has grown too big and indolent to care about quality.  It will cost them as more customers previously loyal, such as I, shift their purchasing to other more competent avenues.",2024,9,August,2024,12,1,0,CA

I opened my parcel (it looked tampered with) only to find 2x toastie makers and not my Ps5 that I ordered. There’s some shady corruption going on at Amazon as they’ve told me they’ve processed my refund (it’s been over a month now since they said that, still nothing)  (the business I ordered from it has fake reviews and is recommending by Amazon and they keep changing their name on the Amazon website). 6 year customer I’ve been of Amazon and this how they treat customers. Absolutely shameful so be warned people do not order any expensive products as 1. You’ll have a shady business that Amazon have let on their platform 2. Delivery driver will probably rob your expensive item 3. You won’t get a refund back due to their dodgy practices and you’ll have to take it up with your bank. Save your mental health do not order off Amazon.

After 25 successive support cases I decided to leave the money in the Spanish account. - A customer complaining on a product label that did not completely match those on the picture. (Really?). Surprisingly Amazon granted the claim and refunded the customer. I have no way of getting the products back. Amazon does not support, cannot even explain why I am not eligible to open a Safe-T claim... (Really?)- Suddenly blocked account + balance for under the context of mismatch in address (untrue- nothing changed) - only by contacting an old contact in the Amazon organisation it was released again (this doesn't work anymore).

You pay monthly fee for faster shipping, but then theres a 99% chance your item will be damaged from mishandling by drivers / shippers, or were in damaged, unsellable condition to begin with. I've seen drivers throw packages at people's doors! Shippers dont bother to even think about what they're packing so there will be insufficient padding to protect from drivers' mishandling or their intentional damage when throwing items. I cant order anything that i want to arrive in brand new unbroken condition. The only things i can order are things that can handle a little bit of a beating in transit, but thats barely anything. Order a ""brand new"" blu ray, receive a previously opened blu ray that was shrinkwrapped and melted with a heat gun. Order a brand new book, get a book that was completely destroyed from bouncing around in a box 3x its size with no padding or all messed up from being in a soft bubble wrap envelope, and that is if they arent completely destroyed by the shipper/fullfillment center. Believe it or not, but amazon used to have special packaging for books and movies so that they dont get damaged but nobody in this self-serving megacorporation cares anymore. 98% of items are off-brand chinese products that belong at a 99 cent store that are priced as high as the real brand-name products they're disguising themselves as. These products break either right away or very shortly after return windows. They typically ship with some type of offer for gift cards in exchange for reviews, padding up the reviews of their inferior products. The product page makes them appear as a brand name product, but the item comes in a generic unsealed box. You would get better at five below but it was priced at $40. This is pretty much the entire store. Trusted brands with names like, ""gOOprOO"", ""WYdaiBother"" are amazons recommended choice.

US,"I have a surgery scheduled for August 16th and need to follow a clear liquid diet the day before. I have been trying to order clear protein drinks for two weeks now, and Amazon has so far failed to deliver all of them. The first product was 5 days shipping and the day before delivery the shipper broke some of the bottles--not Amazon's fault, obviously. The problem was how Amazon handled it. When I called, they told me they communicated to the company to initiate the replacement now, so it could be delivered  by the following Saturday. By the next day I still did not see a status change on the Amazon app for the product, so I called again--I was told by the person that she ""guaranteed"" I would receive the replacement by Saturday. Saturday arrived and still no change in shipping status to indicate the item was shipped--in fact, the only update was to state I was receiving a refund--so I called Amazon again. The first agent lied to me and tried to tell me he could ""help"" by initiating a refund (the refund had already been initiated the day before). I had the call escalated and I was told the item was never replaced and that none of the agents should have told me what they did. It was also too late to order that item as new orders would arrive after the surgery date. I looked for a different clear protein drink (that isn't red or purple). By now the surgery was only a few days away. The item I found indicated it could be delivered same day, between 5 and 10 p.m. Eureka, I thought. I ordered it. Of course it didn't arrive. That night the app updated to say that it would be delivered by 8 a.m. the next day. It wasn't. I called Amazon again. This time they have no idea why the item wasn't delivered and they still had no idea if or when the item might be delivered today. I had the call escalated. She didn't know either. She also couldn't reach the area that handles shipping to find out when the item would be shipped. She ended up refunding the first item (while not canceling it) and recommending a new order be put in to try to get the item delivered by this afternoon--halfway through the clear liquids day. I did as she suggested and put the second order it, but I really have very little confidence  Amazon can make it happen anymore. Unfortunately, these are not the only examples of failed and late deliveries with this company. It's become commonplace. While I was on the phone with the escalation team, I submitted my order for the first items I am moving to Walmart and away from Amazon. I will find replacements for the rest of my items and then cancel Prime before the end of the month. For those who may be holding off on canceling Prime because you like the streaming, be aware that after you cancel you can pay for a streaming-only option for $9 a month--less than the $15 a month or so we pay for Prime shipping. If I find the streaming worth keeping (TBD), that is what I will switch to. The rest of the company isn't worth my hard-earned money anymore. Moving on.",2024,8,August,2024,2,1,0,US

US,"I’ve been an Amazon customer for many years, and after over a decade, I need to say something about my experiences. Whether this message reaches many or not, I’m sharing my direct experience. Amazon is undeniably convenient, fast, and easy to use, but it comes with serious risks, including fraud, financial theft, and receiving dangerous products. Using Amazon is like gambling with your money. I’ve had Amazon commit fraudulent transactions, charging me double and triple what I should have paid, which I had to sort out with my bank and they confirmed Amazon has been doing this to me. I’ve ordered a wide range of products from Amazon, and it's always a hit or miss regarding quality. I’ve even been hospitalized after receiving extremely foul food and drink products from Amazon. For instance, condiment sauces were so spoiled and contaminated that they nearly unalived me.I’ve encountered countless instances of products being falsely advertised and misrepresented by Amazon and its sellers—everything from grills and clothing to dolls, groceries, electronics, health items, automotive parts, sports gear and more. I’ve been defrauded multiple times over the years, with a recent example being defective and dysfunctional devices sold through numerous sellers. They just robbed me again of thousands of dollars for electronics. It’s clear that Amazon is aware of these issues because many others have been scammed in the same way. Amazon takes our money and delivers trash. Returning items is a hassle, and it's not always feasible for people.Amazon allows these fraudulent sellers to operate and benefits from their schemes. These sellers are slick, and anyone who has dealt with them knows what I’m talking about. The same applies to Amazon's customer service. It’s some kind of business model to take a bunch of money and provide devices that doesn’t work. This shouldn’t be legal. I’m not a legal expert, but this ongoing issue can’t be right.While I have received some good products from Amazon, the negative experiences far outweigh the positives. This is crazy.

US,Through out the years Amazon continues on its trend downwards. What blows my mind is that even with this disgusting rating I’m willing to bet many people here still purchase from Amazon. Which is why ratings some times are meaningless. Here is the issues:1. Prime shipping. Perfect for home delivery a freaking nightmare for apartment delivery. Plus their whole logistic side is ran by partners and has the lowest moral on earth. So basically every time you purchase something you’re asking an angry employee to take it deliver to you. Can you see why instructions aren’t followed and there is a high rate of shipping failures mostly to apartment buildings? 2. Through the years brand names became less and knocks became the focus. And to make sure you’re forced to go for the knock offs guess what they deeply discount the knock offs while keeping brand prices high. It’s a tactic that makes sure they always win and you lose. 3. Support is non existent. People found a way to get around it and escalate so they patch it back to the incompetent support team. People found another way to escalate they patched that too bringing it back to the same disgusting support team. So people found ways to reach their dispatch side to better track things. So Amazon again closed that off and forward the number to support. You could email the ceo directly to escalate that email doesn’t work anymore. Would could go to consumer protection or BBB or any other way short of a lawsuit it falls on death ears. Meaning they made it so the incompetent support team is your only communication to them. And to clarify I say incompetent because they don’t train the team or give them tools to resolve the issue. What we see on the app is the only information support is also given. 4. Decreased same day shipping. Majority of times if I need something it’s now labeled as a two day prime shipping. And the continue to decrease shipping through other carriers to the point it is almost strictly just prime shipping. And prime shipping is worthless. 5. The route items through warehouses that can be multiple hours away from you when they have warehouses next door to you. This pissed off drivers who then have no incentive to deliver your package on time. And if they run late even though you asked for same day your package will be 2 days late. 6. They don’t care about being customer based they are following the ways of every other tech company out there. Going from having an awesome reputation to no reputation at all. None. Or having the bottom of the barrel worst reputation ever. Point is Amazon has no incentive do lift a finger. They are just going to continue to push crap even with the federal government investigating them it still won’t do a thing for them. This is what happens when a company becomes too big without being regulated more strictly. They become dangerous and unstoppable. If you can find the item elsewhere I strongly suggest getting it there. For me tech needs I go to tech stores around the area. Sure higher prices but I don’t care. At least there is no headaches. I go in I grab the box of what I need I pay for it and that’s it. ,2024,8,August,2024,28,1,0,US

US,"We've been Amazon customers since we were in school many, many years ago. Today's Amazon is no longer a store we feel safe shopping at. Just some highlights.We frequently get items that are different from their advertisements--and for the worse. Many items fail within the first few months, but when we look back at our order history to review the ad, the company that had offered the items is no longer on Amazon. Suspicious. We can't trust Amazon reviews anymore. Lots of low quality foreign goods with 4.5 and 4.6 star reviews, but too many of these reviewed products we buy turn out to be trash that can't even last 3-months. Whenever we write a positive review, Amazon publishes it without a hitch. But most of our negative reviews are flagged and removed, despite our not finding any justification for this in Amazon's own review guidelines. No Amazon rep ever gets back to us to explain what's up.Amazon's customer service is unreliable. We've lost track of how many times a chat support agent has given us instructions and promised us we can trust them, but later it turns out they were wrong. And we have to bear the financial cost of THEIR wrong instructions. Even when issues are elevated to ""supervisors,"" we've been given false information that's cost us money. Today, Amazon is often just unwilling to compensate customers hurt because of Amazon's or Amazon's reps' errors.About one in three items delivered to our home arrives damaged. So the gas we waste driving long distances to Amazon return drop off centers adds up. Why are we PAYING resources to return Amazon's junk? No more.Amazon HAS WRONGLY CHARGED OUR CREDIT CARD for items we have proof were returned to Amazon because, so customer support supervisors have told us, this trillion-dollar company can't keep track of its own shipping network. So the customer ends up wrongly paying for it. Google it--several US state attorneys generals have taken or are taking legal action for Amazon wrongly charging customers for items that were timely and correctly returned.I could go on and on. Once, Amazon was THE STORE our family could rely on--not just to get what we wanted, but to be treated fairly, to be able to trust what Amazon's reps, especially supervisors, told us. No more. And now it's costing us more money to do business with Amazon than we save by not shopping elsewhere.So after decades of shopping on Amazon, we've closed our account and aren't looking back.

Every single account that gets delivered here has instructions set for business days, business hours, and the specific door to deliver to.  Each set of instructions says to never leave packages unattended, and that it they are left unattended, that Amazon is responsible for replacement or refund.Nevertheless, they continue to dump packages, even when the business is long-closed, and they continue to get stolen.They even have had the nerve to claim that they have had ""problems delivering"" due to our complaints about their misbehavior, and theft.They don't care that their drivers nearly collide with people.

AU,"Worst ever company. I have never dealt with such an incompetent bunch of morons. How this company seizes to exist amazes me because their customer service is non existent. Listing products, an absolute nightmare.I will provide an example of just how idiotic they are.I have been sending the same clear message regarding why Generic is in my product title when there is a brand associated with it. 10 times and mind u, it is still ongoing, i have sent the exact same message asking them to remove the term generic from the title and they keep sending me the exact same automated responses.I have came to the conclusion i am speaking with low level ai bots.Another example. I sent an order to a customer as per delivery address. It couldn't be delivered because of a insufficient address. I asked the customer to pay for re delivery and what does this disgusting company called Amazon do. They refund the customer in full making me lose out on the shipping from the customer's address and back to me. Disgraceful. When it comes to customer service, there will never be anything worse then Amazon ",2024,8,August,2024,45,1,0,Other

I argued with them, I sent them screenshots of my order but they just kept saying I only had $12 and Amazon has been glitching out. Ok, whatever, I'll pay the extra 3 bucks. 2 hours after being charged I noticed a 2nd charge from Amazon. I contacted Amazon again and they told me it was to cover the rest of my order. I argued with them, I sent them screenshot shots of my order and of the conversation I had through chat and informed them I had the phone call recorded as well. I was told I'd be refunded the 2nd charge and even got an email about it. 8 business days I still wasn't refunded, so I contacted Amazon again, and they claimed to have no clue about a refund, I sent them the screenshots of my order, the chats, the email about the refund and informed them I had the previous phone calls recorded as well. The guy straight up said, ""you were lied to, there is no refund. The extra charge was to cover your order"". I informed the guy that I was saving the conversation and phone calls and reporting fraud to my card company, which I did. Amazon was trying to get my credit card company to wait a other 15 days and I straight up told my card company NO, that I don't trust Amazon at all and they are a bunch of thieves and I want to file immediately, which they did.

US,My review is based on customer service.. because there is none. Amazon has their system set up so that you're stuck talking with robots who give u options that are useless. It's nearly impossible to ever get the chance to speak with a live agent and when you do they just throw links at you and make you wait 5 mins per question. It's very frustrating and disgusting with all the money this company makes. ,2024,8,August,2024,1,1,0,US

US,"I used to love Amazon many many years ago. Back then, when they didn’t deliver on their prime promise, they refunded you your monthly prime fee. Now, so many things go wrong and they don’t hold themselves accountable. 1. The customer support chat is a super hidden feature. I’ve figured out how to access it now, but they make it super hard to get in touch with someone. 2. Deliveries are never on time. They promise next day delivery but many of my orders get delayed. 3. Multiple times I’ve ordered “used- but in good condition” products for a smaller fee to be eco-friendly but many times items of the orders have been missing and it’s on me to package everything up again and haul it to the post office for a return.

GB,"Appalling Customer Service When dealing with the Security of Your Property I was an Amazon Prime customer for 5 years, and after 4 months of couriers ignoring delivery instructions, asked Amazon to take action on drivers that refuse to to do so, as it was causing a security problem.It's important to note we have elderly parents at home that need a little extra time to respond to a courier. We also live a in time where security issues arise from time to time, particularly in urban areas.Theft can be a problem at any time but when deliveries are left unattended for any length of time, it's a red wragg to a bull! I get that drivers are generally in a rush to get to the next delivery and are human, but these days there's a  noticeable trend for couriers to often ignore instructions to wait until someone answers the door,drop the item on the doorstep and move on. One customer support person informed me that these are called ""unattended deliveries"" Genius.Reporting this to their Deliveries and Logistics department turned out to be a fruitless exercise (so please save yourself the time and hope). Despite assurances to look into the problem, the problem kept reoccurring, and bizarrely logistics kept on giving the same assurances. Its eternal loop!They may well investigate the problem, whilst it continues to happen but will claim, due to GDPR and to protect the drivers identity claimants are not allowed to know the outcome of the investigation in any way. Utter garbage.So you will never know if the problem has even been addressed and since it keeps happening, whatever efforts they may or may not of made, ultimately amount to nothing. I'm sure you can spot the loophole here..I'm sure they are lovely people doing their best, but I have cancelled my prime membership and saved 9 pounds a month for a similar service - they will not offer any other resolution and, as a manager told me after 3 hours of speaking to customer support,  ""we cannot change our policy and there's nothing more we can do"" Avoid this happening to you because they are not serious about your security.",2024,8,August,2024,4,1,0,GB

I ordered the “NEWUREHO Ice Silk Male Casual Suit, Size: Medium” and was very disappointed with its quality and size.

Upon contacting customer service, I was informed that the product was not received and that they would check and get back to me within two days. Instead, the next day, I received the product back.When I contacted customer service again, they said they would investigate and get back to me. After two days, they informed me that the product would be picked up within 72 hours. However, no one came for the pickup, and I received a return request cancellation message. I conveyed this to customer service, who assured me to wait until 31st July 2024 for a solution. On 31st July, I called customer service, only to be rudely told that my return request was refused because I supposedly cancelled it. This was not true; the return request was cancelled automatically, and I had been in constant contact with customer service, who assured me it was being handled.This entire experience has been extremely frustrating and feels like a fraudulent practice.

Items rarely arrive on time or when promised even if you pay extra for expedited shipping.  I asked numerous times for a corporate officer's name and phone number to contact and was told by customer service that they don't have access to that.  I call BS I did a google search and found the corporate office phone numbers in less than a minute.  If I can do it, why don't they!  Customer service is absolutely worthless and does not resolve problems.  They constantly pass you off to different people without warning, 4-5 different Customer Service reps per chat, or just flat cut you off turning off the chat without warning.  Then they claim it closed automatically due to inactivity. Only to have to resay everything you already said or make you log back in to try again. I am stern and direct but never curse or ask for inappropriate resolutions.  In fact, all I have ever asked for is my product to be delivered and give me a real date that I can expect delivery when promised. They will then tell you they are issuing a refund because the system gives them no other option and when the item arrives you can keep it.  All the while insisting it will be delivered. But then they go in and cancel the order ensuring you never receive it.  Not that it matters because even items I clearly told them I didn't want a refund never arrive and then I have to have another terrible interaction to get the refund because it never shows up. This defeats the purpose we order thing because we want or need them and do not want them cancelled, we want them delivered when promised. I have a business and personal prime account with Amazon But will be cancelling and never ordering again from them from either account.  I pray people read this review and do the same thing to ensure you do not have these problems.

The inability to cancel or receive a refund for the delivery fees adds to the frustration.Decision:Due to these ongoing issues, I have decided to cancel my Amazon subscription. The repeated failures in delivery and poor handling of these situations have led me to seek more reliable alternatives.Overall, this experience has been extremely disappointing, and I hope Amazon takes steps to improve its delivery services and customer support.But looking at all the previous reviews they never seem to read any of them so they will never learn how to improve.Sincerely,",2024,7,July,2024,18,2,0,GB

US,Amazon has gone from a phenomenal company to a horrible company in  just a couple of months. Returns used to be seamless and now they are a nightmare. Their customer service has become arrogant and will hang up on you when you get frustrated and upset with them. Returns are an absolute nightmare. If it’s from a third-party seller you can’t take it to Staples  you have to take it to UPS. The UPS store is 25 minutes from me! Several months ago I had a problem with a wicker chair from a third-party seller. It was a complete nightmare… the seller canceled the order and I ordered somewhere else and then they delivered the chair anyway..it was an absolute nightmare trying to get it back to the seller UPS refused to pick it up and kept asking me for a tracking number and I said I don’t have the tracking number you give me the tracking number  it’s here it’s ready to be picked up and they just refused to pick it up. Amazon‘s A-Z guarantee is an absolute joke they don’t stand behind it. I probably spend five hours of my time on this chair and trying to return it. Eventually I charged it back on my bank credit card. My bank came down on my side. If all of that isn’t bad enough now they are requiring signatures and codes in order to deliver your packages. How can someone give a signature if they are at work so your package goes back-and-forth eventually you don’t get it at all and then you can try re-ordering it and hope that you’re home when they come by for your signature. I ordered items for my brother and they sent the code to me by the time I got it to my brother it was too late the driver had already been there they tried again to deliver and he wasn’t there and eventually all the items went back to amazon. Who in the world is running this company? I understand they arehaving problems with stolen packages but the solution is that the customer doesn’t get their package at all!!! so is it worst if its stolen or to have amazon take it back because they’re not able to get your signature or some code in order to leave your package.?  I don’t know if they’ve been taken over by new management but I have never seen such a terribly run company and how that can happen in a few short months is just beyond me.,2024,7,July,2024,11,1,0,US

There is zero reason why a place like amazon CANNOT protect your purchases for a extended period of time beyond 30 to 60 days..after 30 days because the items were small I just ignore bad items..take the hit..but on big ones this is bad.I purchased a solar generator for a VERY good price I knew would not come around again if I passed up that deal so I purchased it...it was such a great deal that I was going to purchase two but when I went back it was the last one and discontinued. Ok no biggie.  I didnt need to use it then. But knew in tbe near future I would with what I have been dealing with.So I got it nov. 11 of 2023. I just opened it to set it up last week of june 2024 when to my dismay the thing did not work at all...ony the charging part..no lights..no power receptacles worked nothing. I had video taped the whole unboxing because I was going to start uploading randon things to you tube.So I contacted Amazon...they said they contacted the seller successfully and I should hear from them within 48 hrs. Ok...nothing..two weeks so far nothing..so finally I called back amazon because they said if I didnt hear back and no resolution call them back so I did..ONLY for them to say there is nothing they can do..then I pressed a lil to say look this is a total loss I just opened it..the item was on sale at real low price you wouldnt find else where for a 1100 watt solar generator for 300 bucks...so the rep put me on hold and finally came back and said give VB direct 24 to 48 hrs to respond..so what it seems like if they dont respond I am sol.This is pretty bad I cannot imagine the yearly loss to customers because of Amzon policy. 30 days goes by in a flash especially with how our lives are consumed with various things. Its not unheard of for people to buy something they know they could later because they found it at a price they know just never happens or wont when they will need it.So what..only buy something you plan on using immediately? While nothing I am sure will come of this and this will be a 300.00 loss to me.There is no reason Amazon cannot provide solid purchase protection for people purchasing from their site. It a 30 day return policy stated...but they MAY.. with some persistance provide help up to 60 days.. not listed in their policy but a internal manegerial understanding from how it was conveyed..and that leniency is provided based soley on circumstance.Amazon could easily recover losses through insurance if not from the vendor on items solidly proven to have just been accessed by the buyer..and rightfully yes..only with solid proof like I have.. Add to policy for sellers that they are atleast responible for damaged item up to 190 days. And if the seller have stopped selling on Amazon before that time is up then selectively with solid proof from the buyer the item was just opened months after purchase.  Then insurance claim and favors the buyer.The buyer is what makes all company that provides a platform for sale of items or actually sell items...so this was a massive loss to me because of Amzon policy. ,2024,7,July,2024,3,1,0,US
GB,Packing materials were due today but weren't delivered and I was told by Amazon Customer Service would now be by 1st August 2024. I am moving house on this date so won't physically be here to take receipt of the goods. I was told I would have to wait for the goods and then return them. I can't do this because I won't be here. I explained this but they refused to listen. I requested the order be cancelled and credited. I was told they can't do this (more like won't). Utterly arrogant and useless.

JM,"I am warning everyone about Amazon and their Amazon Prime membership tomfoolery.  On the 17th of July 2024, I saw ""prime day deals"" on two items. One was a ring doorbell for $99.99 and the other was for a spotlight camera for $109.99. I signed up for a Prime Membership on that same day in order to get the Prime Day deal for these two items. I received an email on the 22nd of July 2024 from them that I needed to update my payment method and one of the items needed to be paid for. I thought that was strange since I had the exact amount of money listed on the 17th of July 2024 on my card. I contacted customer service and they told me to pay full price for the two items temporarily, then when they were delivered I could go back to customer service and receive a refund for the difference. I decided to contact customer service tonight for a refund of the difference but to no avail. Customer service was poor, and they had me going around in circles for 4 hours as I explained to about 6 different people what was happening. Finally, I was told I could return the items for a full refund. This was trickery and fraud on the part of Amazon.",2024,7,July,2024,1,1,0,Other

GB,"I have never had any problems whatsoever with our local amazon.co.uk. Customer service is almost always great and they're not difficult to deal with for returns and refunds at all. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth for amazon.com where my wife ordered a single book which arrived damaged.At first, everything seemed to be dealt with smoothly. Customer service assured my wife that a replacement book would be sent free of charge and the original item did not need to be returned (sensible, given the costly logistics involved for them with international shipping). The replacement book arrived and was in the condition you would expect a new book to be.Fast forward about 3 weeks... I check my bank balance for no reason in particular and I see a charge from amazon.com. Now, I haven't ordered from Amazon.com ever in my life, but I knew my wife had and asked if she had ordered something again and accidentally selected the wrong card (my card, which is linked as a ""household"" in our account settings).It turns out, no, she had not ordered anything from Amazon.com but, upon contacting their customer service, I was informed that they had charged MY bank account rather than the account used for the original order to claw back money for failing to return an item ---> an item THEY ASSURED US did not need to be returned!Then the circus really began as they forced us into the weirdest game of whack-a-mole I've ever encountered... They couldn't talk to me about taking money out of my account because the order was in my wife's account....And then told her they couldn't talk to her about money coming out of my account because it was not in her name... Then they insisted we call a ""toll free number"" IN THE BLOODY USA (which is never going to be toll free when calling from the UK!!) and finally...after about 3-4 hours of both of us pushing and pushing and telling them there was no way we were getting on the phone because the cost of the phone call would be greater than the refund value, I FINALLY got confirmation that the refund would be issued.Then, I receive an email (sent twice...) stating that the refund would be ""issued in 3-5"", not days not weeks not hours, just ""in 3-5""...But I figure I'll wait and see... And what do you know? 17 days later... No refund! So now, I get to start the circus all over again because it has become a matter of principle at this point. This is no longer about $27 and change.

I spoke to somebody from customer service named Lawrence who said they cannot refund me until the 30th, I asked Lawrence if they thought it was professional for delivery drivers to fail to actually let the recipient know the parcel is there by knocking or using a doorbell and they kept refusing to answer the question, they didn’t seem to fully understand or grasp basic concept of delivering a parcel correctly. Lawrence then said in his culture people don’t knock on the door which actually has nothing to do with the delivery whatsoever and sounds unprofessional and quite stupid. It was so inappropriate and silly it was like having a conversation with a small child. I think that maybe Lawrence could do with a different job that they better understand.

US,"Bezos (Amazon) partnered with our post office next door that was slated to close and created a nightmare. Our postal carrier was not coming to work and stealing our mail after the change. With Amazon next door they began working at 2am and worked until 10pm and 12am daily. All the beeping of the backup signals on the trucks, sometimes dozen before noonl would drive you nuts  This went on all day and into the night, you couldn't get any sleep. At times with all the mail carts on the pavement it would sound like a train station. For my complaints to the Post Master General things just got worse until Amazon handed over a pair of $800 speakers to the Post Office who left, next door, with my speakers before 8am and delivered them late after 9pm, 13 hours to deliver from next door and with the box full of hammer holes. I knew it was a threat. My creditor returned my money but later gave it back to Amazon without any notice or explanation. It was shortly after that while in my wheelchair I was attacked, assaulted. My nose, right hand and foot were broken. My motorized wheelchair was tipped over andall the while two females employees irked he driver on with every punch. Then they had the gall to have me arrested. ",2024,7,July,2023,4,1,0,US
US,Numerous deliveries have been made to my residence by the same driver. A driver who has been disrespectful calling me out my name. All because I have repeatedly asked for packages to be placed behind the gate on porch instead of on the steps and or pillar to be stolen. I've had packages stolen and installed a gate to keep this from occurring. I've contacted Amazon on numerous occasions being assured he would not deliver here again lies and packages would be placed in the appropriate place lies. I'm sure my few thousand spent a yr is nothing to them. They will say whatever to try to make you feel better about the next order but obviously do not care. I refuse to spend money for things to be stolen and talked to like trash. The whole purpose is to help accommodate those who can't get out and shop.

CA,"I am Boycotting Amazon. I will take my business to Walmart.  Here's why, I purchased blink Cameras on Prime day. The original cost was $519.95, due to the Prime discount last week the cost I paid was $190.27. The Products did not get delivered,  they were returned to Amazon marked as ""damaged"", so totally not my fault.  I contacted Amazon to Not refund me, to just resend the items.  But No, they said they had to refund me and I had to place a New order at the original price of $519.95 and then once it's delivered I can call to get the promotional difference refunded.  So I did...I paid $519 for $190 worth of items and called for my refund... and of course...I go through 5 ppl who end with telling me despite the fact that I was told and sent an email stating I would get the promotional price... that I actually would Not be gettingany refund And they're was nothing more they could do for me and would be disconnecting the call...Horrible customer service, especially considering I order probably an avg of $500 a week on amazon.... so I requested ups to pick the items up for return.

They keep your address and credit cards used on file and do very little when your account is hacked.  Customer service submits tickets to it fraud department which takes 24-48 hours to fix.  The hackers put a two step verification with their phone number.  Amazon does nothing.  They remove the two step but due to their system - they get a text message saying it is removed.  They can order items and use your cards saved.  Amazon tells you - you need to work with your bank not our problem.  If the hackers order items and Amazon cancels them - They can still pick it up.

Last week, I got an email accusing me of violating 'community rules' and threatening me with removal of privileges if I 'continued'. No other information was provided I had no idea what this meant so concerned my account had been compromised I phoned customer services. They couldn't tell me anything but reported to community help. I also reported as a potential scam but had no response. Community help said they could help only if I provided details but Amazon wouldn't give me details. I asked for the official complaints procedure 4 times but again, no response. I decided to close the account but after removing all stored payment methods, it refused to recognise my email (despite using that email to contact me) which meant I couldn't close the account. I checked all contact and remembered I had told them they had sent me inappropriate question. They sent me a customer question which wanted technical details and should have gone to the seller but noone would tell me if that was considered a 'violation' (cheek). Today, the account recognised my email so I've deleted the account. I've checked banking etc. details and think I'm OK but Amazon were incredibly bad throughout and I will not use them again.

US,"I started using Amazon back in the 1990s as a graduate student. I purchased my textbooks there as it was cheaper than the university bookstore and tax free. Fast forward to 2008 when Amazon asked me to try prime for free. I did. And didn't realize they charged me $79 for the membership. I decided to keep it because products were cheaper than at on-ground stores, no taxes and free shipping. Then in 2012 China clamped down on counterfeit producers and stopped them from selling product in China. In 2012 Amazon opened the door to these Chinese sellers and Amazon became flooded with a bunch of junk products. The price of prime kept rising, but I kept it because of Prime video and 2-day delivery. When I became sick I relied on Amazon more. Now Amazon is expensive. They have moved lots of shows to Freevee, which I don't watch because I don't do ad TV. And to add insult to injury this year, 2024, they started adding ads to Prime Video and demanding an extra $3/month to remove the ads, citing all of the other services they added to Prime. I don't use those other services, so it is bloatware to me. Stuff isn't being delivered in 2 days anymore. And there have been times when products were lost in their shipping facilities and not delivered. You call Amazon and they outsource their customer service overseas, these people have no way to contact the drivers. This is rubbish. The seller ALWAYS has contact with shipping! Paying extra for same-day delivery doesn't guarantee it will be delivered same-day. Amazon stopped packing cushioning in boxes so I've received items damaged. I've received spoiled food items. I was horrified to learn the tea I was drinking expired months before. Once they shipped me pet food meant to be sold in Mexico. So, even though you purchase from one seller they ship the product that is closer to your domicile, which might not be the same quality. Prices aren't cheaper than the on-ground store anymore, sometimes it is higher. Taxes are included too. So there is no value to having Amazon anymore. I even submitted my SSN & 1099 to sell t-shirts on Amazon. They stopped adding people to the program that didn't have a huge social media following. But refused to delete my information from their database. Lastly, I purchased a product that was defective, a sports watch. I wanted to exchange it. The watch cost hundreds of dollars. The customer service rep wanted to offer me $25 for it. I demanded a supervisor and the US support team processed the exchange. When Hurricane Beryl was bearing down on Houston TX, I ordered the Midland NOAA radio bundle so I could be notified of tornados and floods should I lose power. My home was hit by a tornado in May 2024, so the threat was real. I paid extra for same day delivery. Amazon split the bundle with one part being delivered in a week and the other same-day, except they never delivered it and promised to deliver it AFTER the hurricane. I called and spoke to three reps. One had a fake barking dog sound and you couldn't hear a word she said. After 30 minutes she just told me to call the number I called to get her. Another promised to expedite it. He didn't. Finally I canceled the delivery with the third person. The product was sitting in Houston, I'm in Houston. I don't know why they refused to deliver it. I had to eventually purchase it from another company. This company that started out well is not the same as it was in the past when it cared about its customers. It doesn't care about its employees nor customers now, it only cares about profit. I will not be renewing my prime membership in October.

I waited for them to come to the door as I was on the computer - but much to my surprise they put the truck in reverse and drove off.  Amazon then informed me that the company rejected the delivery because they couldn't contact me.  Complete and utter BS.  I was sitting in the house with an open window and could see the driver.  Nobody called, nobody came to the door, and the ""Pickup failed: Carrier rejected your return"" just illustrates how crappy Amazon service is becoming.  Seriously - they must think people are stupid and have unlimited time on their hands.  Now they want to reschedule (another day off work - another lost PTO day (± $550) and for what?  Drivers that are too damned lazy to do their job??  UPDATE - after three calls to Amazon (Philippines) and 90 minutes this morning they rescheduled the pickup to Wednesday - another day of PTO, another $550.  We'll see what happens.",2024,7,July,2024,2,1,0,US
GB,"I purchased a £25 BENEFIT makeup product from Amazon but received a different Benefit product Amazon were selling for £9.99.I attempted to start a return and was promptly told due to the product being a makeup item a return was not possible.I contacted Amazon customers and raised a complaint. This was the only way I could get past the “return not eligible for makeup products” generic response.Amazon customer services did eventually refund the full amount I’d paid, and told me to keep the incorrect product I’d been sent.A couple of days after this I received an email asking me to review the original product I’d purchased but not received. When I tried to leave this feedback, Amazon refused to publish it. Like many folk I’ve always wondered how trustworthy Amazon reviews actually are. I now know, honest negative feedback is not tolerated, after they can’t have folk knowing about this little scam. Amazon have also removed this order from my account history, however I have the screenshots and my bank records too.Be wary of Amazon reviews.

GB,"If I could give this corporation zero stars I would:Constantly tell me items are delivered when they are not; I have a doorstep camera that activates whenever anyone approaches. Items have been left in full view of a public footpath just 3 feet away and then reported as 'handed to resident' when they clearly haven't; I've even had a dinner-service (yes a dinner service) thrown over my gate to be picked up in several hundred pieces.The latest one is a wet and dry hoover shown as delivered when no attempt to deliver was made for which there is video evidence; reported the same day and then told by a (ro)bot on chat 'we're sorry, sometimes things are marked as delivered up to 48 hours before they actually are' - this is a barefaced LIE : items cannot be marked delivered until the bar-codes are scanned by the driver, which they do at the door. This was a box (from the replacement) about 1ft cubed weighing 7.5Kg that it seems was somehow misplaced. It has no outer packaging other than the manufacturers box so its quite obvious what it is and I guess may have been nabbed by the driver for a relative or for E-bay. Nevertheless the message from the (ro)bot says 'please give us 48 hours and then chase us up again.' This is expressly designed to put off very busy people such that they just accept very expensive and completely obvious items going missing and pay for them anyway.I however, didn't give up and reported again on Friday and was told a replacement would be with me by Sunday - which it was; together with an e-mail telling me that if I failed to return the original by Monday, I would be charged on my credit card for it....This is the 'original' that was never received - hence my asking for a replacement!I finally managed to speak to a human being this morning and when I questioned the absurdity of this - he told me 'unfortunately it's just how the system works.' So once again, Amazon processes are aimed to take money illegally from people who are either not tech-savvy or just don't have time to constantly chase orders.Utterly pathetic.My membership is due to renew in September - I will not be.

US,Amazon is a money hungry enterprise with an owner that could care less about anyone but himself. The service is pitiful for both Amazon and Amazon Fresh Market.

US,Amazon prime and Amazon as a whole is pretty sucky these days. Prime customer means nothing. 90 percent of products are from China now. When you look up an item it had a few of repeated ones for pages and at different prices for different prices. They ship everything with USPS. Which is so awful all by itself.  They stopped using there own delivery service. Packages are not tracked great. They disappear then reappear on the tracking. It's such a frickin mess.

GB,"RE: ORDER NUMBER 114-4658012-9669868 (HP LAPTOP - $689)Dear Readers I am an English lawyer and bought a LapTop from Amazon 2 weeks ago. I double checked the customs import duties, was assured it was correct, paid up front, was promised delivery by 16 July 2024 and guess what?... Yesterday I was informed that my LapTop was returned to sender because the tax/duties was incorrect. Thank you Amazon, I was really looking forward to receiving my product and now you will, undoubtedly, have me jumping through obstacles as you hang on to my money and refund in a few months on the premise that you have administrative checks. Shame on you for treating customers this way. Are you going to reimburse me for my loss of % on my bank account, bank charges, inconveince? No way as half the time you use stupid AI.  I tried to phone you in accordance with your helpline and got a message saying press 150 when I did it disconnected me. I repeated this 3 times with the same result. So much for your AI; it's rubbish at the expense of a human being losing their job, income and prospects. Dear Readers, my experience is horrible and causes loss and inconvenience. I would be very cautious in ordering anything expensive which includes import duties / taxes as Amazon's systems are lacking and I will now have lots of hassles and waiting for my refund.It's not  fair as when you order they demand split second payment, but when things go wrong, I am treated like I am at the back of a long queue and I wish I could give a zero star rating.J N STACHIW, SOLICITOR.27 July. This is an update. As predicted, Amazon wrote to me saying wait until 17 August and then contact them again! I presume this was an automated email as a subsequent and human email confirmed the parcel was being returned and payment would be made 5 days later. I asked if I would receive any compensation for loss of bank interest etc and this has been ignored. The conclusion here is that Amazon are now so big that they no longer have to worry about customer care as they did when they started. Commercially they can cut costs by forgetting about customer care and focusing on increasing profits. 20 August 2024Well I finally got my refund after a 6 week delay. This is horrendous as their policy is simply to make customers wait before they give a refund. I asked for compensation for my lost bank charges and their policy is to never compensate. They used to be good but now they are focused on profits with a massive middle finger to their customers. I actually proactively and one of hopefully many who will on principle NEVER use Amazon again.",2024,8,June,2024,2,1,0,GB

US,"I have been a long time Amazon customer. For years I have used Amazon and their services and have had no problems with the company. Recently I started buying Amazon gift cards to accumulate points on my credit cards. Also at times I was able to buy gift cards for a better deal than using my Amazon credit card which only offers 5% cashback on Amazon purchases.Amazon canceled some of my orders and said that my amazon.com gift cards are in violation of their gift card ""terms and conditions"". I called into Amazon and provided documentation showing that these gift cards were purchased legitimately from a third-party. I also showed credit card receipts to Amazon showing that I purchased these gift cards. In going through their terms and conditions I violated none of them. Also the customer service representatives that I spoke with admitted that this was flagged mistakenly as fraud because I purchased many gift cards and it was not my fault. They restored access to my account and credited the gift cards in question to my account.After this incident I thought that everything was fine. As usual I placed more orders on Amazon and they flagged four of my gift cards totaling $423. They accused me of these gift cards being fraudulent which they were not and closed my account. I provided Amazon with screenshots of gift card purchases and my credit card statement showing these gift cards were purchased legitimately but this just fell on deaf ears. Amazon claimed that I was in violation of their “conditions of use”. I went through their conditions of use multiple times and could not find any violation I was guilty of. I asked specifically what violation I was guilty of and never got a response.Let me reiterate that I have done nothing wrong except buy gift cards from someone other than Amazon. I provided documentation proving my innocence but this did not matter. Being a long time and loyal Amazon customer this really was upsetting. Amazon stole $423 in gift cards from me that I purchased legitimately, canceled my membership, and there is nothing that I can do about it. Any proof that I sent to Amazon was completely ignored. Unfortunately I thought Amazon was a better company than this but it seems that they are just a huge organization that really doesn't care about their customers and will actually steal their hard earned money.This being said be very careful about purchasing Amazon gift cards from a third-party because Amazon may steal your money and close your account where you will have no repercussions whatsoever. That's exactly what they did to me.",2024,7,July,2024,5,1,0,US
GB,"Well, Amazon UK, you've truly outdone yourselves. Over the past month, my deliveries have consistently arrived looking like they've been used as piñatas, with contents resembling modern art rather than my actual orders. I'm now at the point where the marginal savings and supposed convenience just aren’t worth it.Your genius move of cramming multiple heavy items in the same box as delicate ones would impress even Alexey Pajitnov. My recent order included two books, which arrived looking like they’d been used in a game of extreme frisbee. There was no packing material, no bubble wrap, absolutely nothing to keep them safe. Clearly, a thin layer of cardboard is an impenetrable fortress from the underpaid, workforce responsible for packing, shipping, and delivering our orders.To make this comedy of errors even more delightful, your customer service is a labyrinth designed by a sadist. Trying to find a human to talk to is like searching for a unicorn. And let's not forget the cherry on top: there's no way to avoid having EVRi handle my deliveries, ensuring the cycle of destruction continues.Amazon, your service is a farce.

In addition to that their drivers insist on driving into my driveway and up to my gargage instead of parking on the street and walking up to the front door or garage door.  The driveway is narrow and there is insufficient room to turn their vehicles around to drive out in forward gear.  They must drive out in reverse, which many cannot do.  Consequently they have damaged my property by driving off the driveway and/or driving into the traffic cones and reflectors that I have placed along the driveway.  I more recently got a block to place at the end of the driveway to prevent them from driving in.  In response they began to leave packages at the driveway block which is about 8' from the street.

CA,"PS on my Amazon Review: Some consumer review sites ask “What could Amazon do Better” after my reviews were published. Amazon knows exactly what they can do better. Better for themselves not for their customers. The reason that hundreds of thousands Amazon customers in North America and the UK have had it with Amazon is that it has lost it’s unique selling proposition that got it where it is today. Amazon used to be a seamless shopping experience, No More. Price points the same and higher than Brick and Mortar retail and other on line companieswith better delivery on time arrivals than Amazon.  Forget Prime for next day delivery that is also a has been that we pay for. An increased volume of subpar third party products with Zero warranty from both Amazon and the seller after thirty days. Proving that Amazon has approved the seller and the 30 day return window making Amazon an accessory to alleged fraud. All it says to the Amazon customer is buyer beware. Amazon customer service especially in situations like reporting a non functioning product a day after the 30 day window is closed is an hour long run around pre designed to run your through endless hoops without a resolution through attrition to get you off their backs and keep your money. Absolutely pathetic on Amazon. I have no intention of doing business with any corporation that has no real time respect for long time loyal customers, zero integrity and honesty, and are still desperate to make every penny they can get from us by hook or by crook to top of their Billions.

US,My problem is with amazon delivery - the driver attempted delivery over an hour prior to the scheduled delivery times of 7am because i suppose it was convenient for them - and then requested I provide the security access code to my home - UNACCEPTABLE!!!! There was a reason that delivery  window time was accepted  - when i told Amazon to have the driver come back during the scheduled delivery window - they said it may not be until tomorrow- when i asked to cancel the order - i was told it was not possible- i then asked for a supervisor who then was amazingly able to cancel it!!! However failed to log a complaint until i demanded he do so - i then a heard bunch of typing 😏 - when i asked what was to be done - he basically said its up to the center to decide if anything - 😠 !! Amazon is becoming a monopoly with providing incompetent and bad service and seems to be running amuck with no protocol or set procedures to handle issues - and is randomly doing what it wants when it wants - i will be filing another complaint and now  with the AG to break this monopoly up!

CA,"Forget any support from any third party seller or Amazon for any product with a 30 day non return window. What is astounding is that  every Bric and Mortar and online shopping sites carries products with a standard One Year Warranty. Not Amazon, not with third party sellers. An obvious admission by both Amazon and the third party that you are about to waste your money on a sub par product with no guarantee after 30 days. Try to get help on a non functioning product from Amazon a minute the 30 day window is closed, good luck Suckers. It s the usual at least one hour call with excuses and apologies and a link to get you back to square one. That’s called making certain the Amazon customer gives up through pre planned attrition and both Amazon and the third party seller get to keep your money. I simply took my consumer power in hand, something all of us should do out of self respect if nothing else. I cancelled 12 products in my cart and more products to re buy. Then cancelled my Prime membership as it’s become useless, except for Amazon to get more of our money to top of their trillions. Point in case: Even though I am paying monthly for the primary reason of getting next day delivery, in one month three Prime next day deliveries showed up three to four days late and one not at all. So I’m done with Amazon. And judging from a huge 1-1.2 out of 5 Amazon customer ratings you all should be done with Amazon as well.",2024,7,July,2024,9,1,0,CA

Made several phone calls to C/S only to be told they cant help and cannot send entire order or cannot give me a refund, or would just hang up on me only for  having to call back again and talk to someone else and  explain the partial order again.

GB,"Driver took off with package despite me speaking on intercom and opening the communal block door. Hw took off with my package and despite several attempts of chasing after him and shouting, flagging down his van, he just ignored and took off and clicked on return straight away. Still after 2 weeks I'm waiting for my refund as apparently its still in transit. Amazon customer service associates did nothing to help or compensate me with gift balance like they used to. They treated me unfairly and really badly with utmost disgust. One associate offered me a gift balance but unfortunately got disconnected.  Then evwr since for 2 weeks, I have been trying and trying to get another associate who will give me compensation.  And all I've had is associates not reading or understanding or even caring to give me what I deserve- compensation. They made me stressed and upset and didn't even care. I've cancelled my prime membership and won't be ordering off there for at least 3 months. I did warn them. So instead of them losing £26.67 compensation in gift balance (that i Can only spend on amazon anayway-they would benefit), they now going to lose 3 months worth (a lot of money) of regular orders from a valued and regular customer, as well as a bad review and cancelled prime (£8.99 for 3 months).

US,"Love Amazon for making shopping convenient, but they  play dumb knowing they aren't honoring their own policies.   Especially when things often arrive defective or damaged. They are not honoring their return policy and actually require that I call Amazon customer service for my returns over the last 2 years.  Plus, one day I subscribed to a free 7 day trial on Amazon prime and it automatically charged me and made it impossible for me to cancel online.  It makes sense why the FTC is currently suing Amazon for making it difficult for people to cancel Amazon Prime.  It seems like they are making it difficult to process returns or subscriptions intentionally.  When I noticed my return shipping date was coming up and I still did not have a return shipping label I contacted Amazon.  Their customer support told me they were going to handle it.  Then they transferred me to another department to process the credit - and the other rep got very abrasive and said I was outside my return date and made it clear he is hanging up on me.  I remained polite and told him that online it says I still have time to return. He told me the app was wrong and he was hanging up.  Rude!  I filed a complaint with the FTC and the BBB because they should be investigated.   They should also train their customer service reps on how to speak to people.  When I wrote a review on Amazon about the interaction - of course it says Amazon has several days to review my review prior to posting. I noticed all of my previous reviews were not on amazon!!  They obviously screen reviews and block them. None of my reviews have curse words or links etc.  Just honest feedback. It can be hit or miss since things do get damaged in delivery, items can be defective, etc. I totally understand sometimes things happen.  Customers should not be penalized for these issues and customer service should be assisting instead of the unprofessional behavior and being hung up on intentionally.  Instead of aggressively defending bad business practices they could just honor their own policies. I shop online for the convenience, but if they will not honor their return policy or if I'm going to be yelled at and hung up on when I have to take time out of MY day to call them every time I need to return one of their defective items I will definitely try to limit purchasing items on Amazon.

However, my attempt to return the item has been an incredibly frustrating experience. The third-party seller refused to provide a return slip, leaving me at a loss for how to proceed.In an effort to resolve the issue, I reached out to Amazon customer service five times via chat and phone. During each interaction, I was assured that I would receive a refund within 48-72 hours. Unfortunately, these promises never materialized. On my final attempt to contact Amazon, I was shocked to learn that they were unsure why I had been repeatedly told I would receive a refund, as the item apparently cannot be returned. When I pointed out the 30-day return guarantee clearly stated on the website, I was told this information was incorrect.This experience has left me feeling misled and disappointed. As a Prime member, I expected better support in resolving this issue. Instead, I've wasted countless hours trying to address the problem, only to be told that Amazon cannot assist further. I'm now left with an unwanted product and over $300 out of pocket.This situation raises serious concerns about Amazon's policies regarding third-party sellers and their commitment to customer satisfaction. Why would Amazon allow third-party businesses on their platform if they cannot comply with Amazon's stated policies? Moreover, why isn't Amazon willing to work with customers and sellers to resolve disputes fairly? This system seems to open up opportunities for third-party sellers to potentially scam Amazon purchasers.I would appreciate if Amazon could clarify their policies regarding third-party sellers and returns, improve their customer service to provide accurate information, and implement better measures to ensure third-party sellers comply with Amazon's policies.

GB,"They deserve 0 stars. Please be aware that Amazon is using unethical and immoral practices to con people out of money. They state that if you order goods totalling 35.00 or more, your order is eligible for free delivery. I ordered some essential oils from the same seller. I checked each order to verify that it was eligible for free delivery. When I proceeded to checkout, I skipped Prime, and I was still being charged 4.99 for postage. This is because Amazon had a bottle of the essential oils ticked for premium delivery to arrive tomorrow, which I did not tick.  Customer services were useless as I was told that 3 of the oils were coming directly from a 3rd party seller and not Amazon. This is despite ordering all of the oils from the same seller and all of them being eligible for free delivery. I removed the oil that had the premium delivery cost added to it and attempted to check out. However, a different oil came up for next day delivery. This happened 3 times with the oils that were previously listed for free delivery, now showing a premium delivery cost. There was no option to untick the premium delivery cost as Amazon automatically applies this to your order.This breaches advertising and trading standards and is clearly fraudulent. The customer service adviser stated that the reason for this was that information in baskets changed as orders were updated, and the seller would change the information to reflect what was in stock.  I guess she thought I imagined it all and that I did not know what I was talking about. I will be reporting Amazon to the requisite body as this does need investigating.  It is such a long and frustrating process and a total waste of time. With this big online fraudster.  Your track record is disgusting as you are just interested in profits over people.

GB,"I have been an Amazon customer for many years, I’ve extremely disgruntled to learn the minimum order requirement to get free delivery has risen from £25.00 to £35.00, an absolute disgrace, which is a 40% increase, to expect customers to buy more is shocking especially in the current times of need. Forcing customers to add unnecessary items to their basket just to avoid a delivery fee feels like a slap in the face & a way to increase sales. It may also force customers to pay for Prime. I won't be agreeing to prime, I will order goods to the value of £35 and return items free of charge to get a refund. I will also use a family members prime to get free delivery if required.

I contacted Amazon to get a return label and when I carried the shed that weigh 30 kg plus to the post office they told me that the postage was not covered, I contacted Amazon. They assured me they would get back to the seller who would contact me within two days to arrange return of the goods. Now six weeks later, I am being told by Amazon that The order was placed under a different email address and they can only deal with that person. I have pointed out to them that there must be 100 orders before and since that order all placed under the same email address the same delivery address using the same card. I have spent over 50 hours trying to get my money back I’ve been told on two occasions that they would force the third-party to return my money within seven days which hasn’t happened. I have wrote three letters to their managing director and finally I had an answer over the phone this evening.. The person on the phone has given me absolute no confidence of me getting my money back. He’s saying it can’t be looked at under GDPR The order was placed under a different email address and I’m asking him how that’s happened when all the other orders are showing placed under the right email address. I’ve also asked him when when I applied to return the goods why it came out off my orders on the app making it very difficult for me to take the matter up with their customer services. I am also very concerned that the third-party that I placed my order with on the Amazon website have ceased trading and why Amazon allowing companies that do not trade to sell on their website. The guy on the telephone could not answer that question said he would report it, but I would hear nothing back as it would stay an internal matter. this is clearly not good enough and they as they are not protecting their customers.",2024,6,May,2024,56,1,0,GB

On occasion I have had items stolen. I have order instructions to bring to my front door as I'm partially disabled, but the delivery personnel ignore this.

The issue is some of the products not matching the description - I do think that Amazon could provide a better feedback service and supplier to get regular bad reviews blocked from selling such products or even the platform - perhaps Trustpilot should team up with Amazon for this as you have the platform for reviews?Overall, I am very happy with Amazon, I have been a Prime Customer for over 10 years and will continue to be so - there is more they get right than they don't, and any company with such a diverse range is going to have hiccups from time to time.

Sellers don’t pay for clicks to show their products in search but pay a percentage from the sold price. eBay shows me only the products matching my search criteria. Other marketplaces such as Walmart, Target, etc. are much better too, with fast and free shipping as well.I am not going to pay for this Prime subscription—I am fine with longer shipping.

US,"Just wanted to share an Amazon issue I had today in case you may be unaware of this selling practice.I received a Canon printer as a Christmas gift.  I had a problem with it over the weekend that I could not solve using Canon's online support.  I called Canon this morning as the printer has a 1 year warranty.  Canon said the number of the printer I gave them was not a valid number and I told them that is what is stamped on the front of the printer.  They asked where it was purchased and I told them Amazon.  Canon told me Amazon sent me a Canadian product and therefore the warranty is not valid in the US.  They told me my only recourse was to call Amazon.Amazon did not want to do anything about it since it was after the 30 day return period.  After a rather heated discussion with them about deceptive selling practices they did agree to refund after I return the item.  I got an email from them with shipping instructions and an estimated refund which was 20% less (for a restocking fee).  Another discussion followed and I have to call them after they receive the return for the 20% to be refunded.  They also did not want to refund me for 2 unused ink cartridges I had ordered but they finally agreed after I expressed my opinion on that.  So, after 1 hour and 5 minutes on the phone with Amazon today I get to call them back again for the 20%.Tip of the day:  Don't order electronics from Amazon.",2024,6,June,2024,1,1,0,US

I contacted Amazon again on Friday and was transferred to a so called manager who was extremely patronising and told me to look at my messages on the 15th June and I would see the label. I explained that it was there but it instructs me to print it but he assured me this would be ok and I stupidly took his word for it, as I got sick of him saying 'as I have already told you' and as he then cut me of and didn't have the decency to call me back, so I took this fairly heavy parcel, on foot to the nearest Hermes shop and they wouldn't accept it because it was a print only label and they didn't have a printer, so by this time, I was in tears at the thought of walking home with it, having wasted 1.5hrs. Including another call to Amazon.This has now been going on for 10 days and I hope once I get my refund, I hope I won't have to ever deal with this disgusting company, who just pass the buck to the seller, who they gave the wrong information to in the first place.

I called Amazon two times and asked for the customer service phone number in the U.S. after spending over 1.5 hours on the phone. After speaking with customer service in the U.S. I was told that the credit card I used to make the purshase with would be refunded. Three days went by with no refund. I called again and asked for the customer service phone number in the U.S. and was told there was none. Ruan D. was so rude talking over me and hanging up on me twice. After the second time when I asked for his name, I got an email from Amazon with a list of phone numbers with one for Canada and the U.S. I had already called the U.S. number which went to the Ruan D. I am thinking Amazon cuts off customers from speaking with anyone from the U.S. when they no longer want to deal with the issue. This company is not ethical, and due to its size, there are no regulatory agencies to hold them accountable. Moving forward I will not be giving my business to Amazon. Unfortinately, I am one of the many who is guility of not buying local!",2024,6,June,2024,1,1,0,US
GB,"There is so much wrong with the way Amazon deals with their customers and my experience with the company in the last 10 months, that it is pretty impossible to sum it up in a review. However given the awful experience and their ongoing failure to resolve the issues I feel others who may not have used this platform often or recently should know exactly what they might face if anything goes wrong. My account suddenly appeared to be frozen with the only option to make digital orders -very clever as I subscribe to Kindle- this issue first happened in May 24 which was frustrating as my daughter did not to receive her birthday present which I ordered in plenty of time. Eventually I was told the possible reasons and was passed on to FOUR different people over the space of three hours. I'll refrain from going through all the incompetence I experienced but I'll sum it up by saying it's now 7.15 and today at 3pm I was assured my order had been processed and would be delivered tomorrow, after speaking to 3 people and a manager I'm none the wiser and once again the items I urgently need won't be here! But of course payment has been taken and nobody has advised me not to place a new order, on the contrary I am told I'm a valued loyal customer and there's no reason for me to cancel an Amazon account that I can't access!!! Oh and apparently Complaints and Escalations team doesn't exist despite the email I've received from them and although I am visually impaired the only way to communicate is by email!!! It's so ridiculous I'd laugh if I had the energy after wasting so much time today Added 20/6/24 I've now read multiple reviews of this company and many people seem to have had the same experience as myself.

GB,"Amazon used to be a really reliable company, but recently they have really gone downhill. Whilst the cost of Amazon Prime is going up, the quality of service we are receiving is gong down. I ordered an item on Saturday afternoon specifically because it stated the item would arrive the next day on Sunday. The item did arrive the next day, albeit a little late. But the main problem was the item I had ordered did not work. I set up a return and Royal Mail collected the damaged item to be returned. Whilst I waited for the refund, I reordered another item, the same as what I had ordered on the Saturday, but a different brand. This was due to be delivered on Tuesday. The item I had ordered required very specific batteries to operate, so I added those to the same order to ensure I'd be able to use my item when it finally arrives on Tuesday. The item did arrive, albeit a little late again, on Tuesday as stated. However, for some reason the batteries are coming separate. Amazon did say these batteries would arrive on the same day, Tuesday, by 10pm. However, it's past 10pm and there is no sign of them. Item still waiting to be dispatched according to the app, but still on track to arrive today by 10pm? It's Tuesday night and I'm still without the item I originally ordered to get on Sunday.

DK,"Hands down THE best customer service I've experienced online. I'm in Denmark and have been buying goods from the German Amazon for about a decade now.I've just been given my latest refund, which was for an awful Logitech MX Keys keyboard which luckily had one of its keys fall off after about 18 months, meaning I was still under warranty. I hoped to then be able to sell the brand-new replacement for a decent amount and buy a better keyboard, but Amazon just offered a full refund, which I happily accepted.I've had returns on close to ten orders, some of which have been swiftly closed with ""refund issued, no need to return the item,"" the others returned with a prepaid parcel slip that just needs to be printed and stuck on the box, and once they've received the item back, a refund has been issued.Once I bought twelve bottles of baby oil (enough to get free shipping), and it was delivered damaged with three bottles having escaped through a hole. I called the local carrier and was put in queue as number 90-something. While waiting I checked the Amazon website and discovered the option to have Amazon call you up. I activated it and was immediately called on my phone by an employee who promptly refunded me money for the three missing bottles, no questions asked. The local carrier called me back two hours later.This last refund was set in motion by the friendliest German supporter who laughed with me at my broken German and did his best to follow my better English.If there's one negative, it's that the search function on their own website is basically useless, so I have to use Google with ""site:amazon.de"" added to the query instead.I see many negative reviews based on having been fooled by refund scammers, fake websites, or forgetting your password and blaming Amazon, hating on Bezos (which I agree with), or some other random own-fault issue.I've spent at least 10k € over a decade and NEVER had a bad experience with them.People, if someone randomly calls you up and say they're from Amazon (or any other business), hang up the phone and block that number.

US,"I'm writing what I have tried to write twice, as a review for a product experience on Amazon. My review has been denied with an email from Amazon telling me that my review could not focus on seller, delivery, packaging, pricing, or availability. Wait, what? Isn't it one of these items that we are typically reviewing when we provide a review?I ordered 2 $100 VISA cards, requested next day delivery. Included in the same order were three other items. I was excited when I received a delivery notice for the next day AM. At my doorstep was a typical sealed box and a sealed envelope. The three items were in the box. The sealed enveloped, when opened, contained nothing. Most importantly, it did not contain the two cards. I immediately called Amazon customer service (now clearly offshored - if you've experienced Amazon customer service you will understand) and was told that because it was within 24 hours of the order, I would have to call back the next day. I requested an email, which I received. I called back the next day after spending over 2 hours on the phone, I was finally escalated to a Manager. I was told that cards had already been used, that my situation would be escalated to ""card services"" and I would get a call back within 24-48 hours. I requested an email, which I received. Otherwise, crickets, I never received a call from Amazon ""card services.""I then called the distributor of the card (Sunrise Banks), who advised me that no only had the cards been registered to someone NOT in my name, also that they had been used for an online purchase. They took down my information, sent me an email, asked for proof of purchase of the cards, which I sent to them. And, in that same email advised me that I would hear back from them within 24 hours. Again, crickets. I decided my only course of action was to file a dispute with the credit card company I used for this purchase. They have reached out to Amazon, and in reply I received a completely nonsensical, I kid you not, email from Amazon telling me that I should have called their customer service. The email went on to ask me for a credit card number against which they can charge the costs of my original purchase. It made zero sense.Where in the world did customer service go for Amazon? Horrible, horrible, horrible customer service. I've been an Amazon Prime member for over a decade, longer. This is the first situation I've run into like this with Amazon.

Then it said it was arriving on a different date and then when that date passed the tracking changed to saying it had been delivered two weeks previously. Total lies, they obviously lost or stole it ( Evri) and tried to say they delivered it. Why would I have tracking after this date saying its delayed etc? Anyway I complained to the seller, but as I am new to Amazon I didn’t know I had to contact customer service so I tried to ask for a refund from the seller directly. I went away for a week working then tried again with the seller. It was confusing. When I eventually reached out to customer service ( an AI Bot) they said I was over the deadline for a refund. So basically £28.99 down the drain. Very angry. Never again will I order from Amazon, it’s totally put me off. This online stuff is not as good as they make out, the couriers are often rubbish too.

To assist in obtaining a Police Report , we recommend that you provide a copy of the email that we will send to you to the police to help explain what has happened.

NL,"Issue with the seller on the Amazon platform without getting any help at all.the seller sold a bad quality dry cabinet to me and insisted if I want a full refund I need to return it. fine, of course I'm willing to return and get my money back. however the seller rejected to provide a PAID postage label to me and keep offering me like 20-50 Euro compensation asking me to shut my mouth.Reported this to Amazon and confirmed that the seller needs to provide a PAID postage label to me. then I kept going back and forth to try to get the seller to understand what I'm requesting.of course they didn't get what I meant.and at the end they said if I send the post and fill out the form for the custom. I need to write the value of the item for less than $49 USD. I brought that item for 288 Euro.Im pissed by both seller and Amazon. Amazon as a platform they allowed such a bad quality seller to sell there and now trying to get me to do some illegal stuff just because they don't want to pay the custom?I'm very tired of this and this has been ongoing for 3 months.

US,"Here's a review of a product that I wrote on Amazon, but for some reason it keeps being unsubmitted. So, I came here. ""This product arrived on time and was wonderful the first time that we ordered it. We decided to purchase another. The problem is that the zipper is broken and the fabric is torn. It makes the seat look used instead of brand new.UPDATE:Someone came over to pick up the item before I had a chance to check my email and/or the message left on Amazon website.  I have to work. The guy came to the door, said he could not wait, as his supervisor was with him. He was impatient, maybe stressed because of the supervisor and not exactly polite. (I'm glad he has a job and want him to continue to work, but customer service is a positive thing.)Baseline: He could not take the package as it was not ready. He left a slip and said he'd be back tomorrow. It has to be in the box that it came in.I am 67 years old. I remember when we could return items whether we had the box that we bought them in or not. We were still able to get our money back. I paid for it. It is damaged. I want my money. I don't care. They should be able to take it whether or not it is in the same package.Also, if does not fit. Ironically, because of the damage, ie the zipper does not work, I am able to fit small pieces into the opening left when it is unzipped. I was not able to fix the section with the wheels in the pox though. I had no one to help me at the time and had to pull the wheels off to be more versatile. It took almost tow hours. I could not wait for help, as I have to have it ready. I'm not sure when he will come. I was almost able to fit everything in properly, but the top is unable to close, as some parts stick out.I was finally able to read the massage on Amazon. I can drop it off if it is not picked up. I don't drive. That's one reason why I order online. I have to wait for someone to pick it up for me and I have a deadline to get it back.First, they received their money with no problem. I fulfilled my end of the bargain ASAP. Yet,  I had to wait for them to ship it at their convivence. Now, that i need my money back, through no fault of my own, I can't have it back ASAP, I again have to wait and follow their guidelines to have a refund. Needless guidelines, as returns were previously made whether they fit in the original box or not. I understand that I have to wait for shipments and my refund, but it has to fit in the box? For real? Provide bigger boxes.And, what if I had thrown the box away? I don't have space to keep original boxes.Secondly, I was unable to work during the time that I tried to package it. If we go to court, I want to be reimbursed for the time that I lost. My money was not damaged. Their product was.Thirdly, I have a deadline, I have to get it back ASAP. I will either have to carry this item via bus. It's heavy. or, take an Uber, which is expensive and I want to be reimbursed either way for cost of transportation and my time. I may be able to have one of my sons transport me on their day off and/or after work. It was convenient to have it picked up. I deserve it. They got my undamaged money on time.I wanted to have them replace the seat, which would have been easy for me. The guy could have brought one. It was their decision to return the whole chair. They should make sure that they get it and I get either my money or a exchange.UPDATE:I went back to read instructions on Amazon again. It did not specify that it needed the original box, but did say that it had to be securely packaged. It is, as far as I am concerned. It fits in the box, although it is not sealed and items stick out of it. He can take it to UPS, they will package it and send it back. They did it when I returned an item for Spectrum. Why does it have to be me? He's picking it up anyway. They will do it no matter who brings it. Why me and not him? ",2024,6,June,2024,1,1,0,US

Uncertain how that occurred as Amazon never caught it.I was told by an Amazon rep to close my account and I advised I had recently purchased a 75""TV and was concerned about having proof of purchase should I need it. I was told, it would still be available to me however, I was never able to access the information anywhere.I was then prohibited from posting reviews on my purchases. Amazon claimed due to previous reviews, I was banned from ever submitting reviews again.I don't recall ever posting reviews that would warrant being banned. I made multiple requests for them to tell me what was submitted that caused me to be banned however, Amazon never responded.Now, I'm noticing, each time, I place an order, the delivery time takes longer and longer.I don't think it has anything to do with the above mentioned matters. I think it's Amazon's attempt to get me to join Amazon Prime. I never took issue with the amount of time it took to receive items however, now the wait time is 2+ weeks to receive deliveries. I placed an order the third week of July and the deluvery window for seven items is listed between Sept 7-12. Six weeks for delivery? Uncertain if Amazon is tightening their belts and making non-Prime members pay the price or the quality of Amazon's business practices are is diminishing which eventually happens to many organizations.I began searching other online business to see if I can find better prices etc....I never used to question Amazon's integrity however, there seems to be a bit of a snowball effect which is causing me to question things and stray.....

They have failed to meet their agreement repeatedly and have outsourced their “customer service representatives” To foreign countries where you often cannot understand the language. I am done with this company and have cancelled my subscription. ,2024,6,June,2024,5,1,0,US

First there's the AI Voice asking questions, then the wait for a human being to take your call, and finally the human being intentionally hangs up although I'm certain Raja will claim an accidental disconnect.

I wouldn't have called and wasted my time if I didn't need help, but the person who is to supposed to help me (Raja) decides it's better to end the call.

GB,Amazon customer service / care has really gone down hill! I understand that there are people that take advantage of Amazon but the rest of us suffer. I bought a 1TB Amazon basic micro SD card. Now the new thing is that the send you a code that you must give the driver. I am more than happy with this as it will stop scammers but I was out and had to rush home and then sit and wait for the driver. (NO WHERE WHEN PLACING THE ORDER DO THEY STATE THIS). I  received the card however it was the wrong size (256GB) NOT a 1TB. Now I understand that mistakes happen and that Amazon have to follow protocol they asked me to send some photos of it.   (I sent photos as they request name and date)I did this and explained to them how urgently I need a card (they ensured me I could use the one received) and that there would be a case to see what’s happened. I then spoke to the person and said I am happy to keep the card but please just charge me the correct amount and refund the rest or replace item.  All was ok and yes sure from agent side only to wake up today and they state that only once item is returned a full refund will be issued? (Again I am happy to do this but I explained to the agent I’ll still be on holiday) come to think of it the last few deliveries I have had from Amazon have been terrible from NOT following instructions to just being charged for apps that Amazon think I would like (if I didn’t question it I would of not been refunded) prime has adverts too?? Had anyone else had a bad experience? I been a loyal customer for years yet no compensation or keep the item and here is a voucher or refund. I really need to think about staying with Amazon.  They so quick to take your money yet if it’s a refund can take up to two weeks? My advice is Amazon need to check there items before sending out.

US,"Amazon makes sure a customer can't get in touch when they claim that a delivery has been made to my door or to the porch. First problem: there's no porch. Second problem and the reason for my complaint: THERE'S NO SIGN OF A DELIVERY OF ANY SORT ANYWHERE TO BE FOUND!!! And Amazon makes sure that I will never get it!!! They say to use their chat, only the chat isn't available!!! There were two failed deliveries priced at $8.20 and $11.28. Neither order arrived. I have given the most explicit instructions; maybe I have to draw a photo map as well?!?!?!? Now I worry that all the orders I place are going to be left just anywhere and I'll just pay for things that I'll never receive. I notice that direct interaction is not possible. That forces me to file complaints elsewhere, which is what I am doing now because I am given no alternative. And I don't appreciate lying of any sort. No, it was not delivered to my door. Funny that Walmart managed to deliver to me with no problem. Amazon has failed me. There's no other way to describe it. I feel sick now. This is what is done to a disabled senior male these days. I'll just post my complaint everywhere possible; I have no other alternative. Some possibility of making contact with a human being should be available; when no possibility is made available, ripping off a customer is child's play. If I have to go out and lead the delivery person by the hand to get to my door, TELL ME SO IN PLAIN ENGLISH, A LANGUAGE IN WHICH I HAVE WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED!!! Amazon has a publication of mine on record, so they can't say my instructions aren't clear. What burns me most is the lying. Delivery was not made. The app gives me no way to make contact. Maybe they assume I'll die before a delivery is made. I give up. I have no way of guessing anymore. If Walmart made a delivery to my door, Amazon should have been able to do the same thing -- maybe. Normally, they store large deliveries in lockers on the property here and give the customer codes to log into the lockers. Instead, they claimed to deliver them to my door when there was nothing to be found. I faxed them about this development and received no notice of change in my favor.",2024,6,June,2024,3,2,0,US

When voicing these concerns after not receiving the fourth delivery within a month, I was met with condescension and a lack of consideration. I have found their customer representatives to be snarky, demeaning, and unwilling to actually fix the issue or offer compensation. Even their apologies are rude.

GB,"I have a legal right to cancel in the 14 days cooling off period under distance selling regulations. I cancelled the £620 purchase of an O2 SIM from a 3rd party seller when I found it did not work in my area - contrary to what their website says - but the seller would not cancel. I cancelled on the advice of O2 where, after several attempts to check the SIM activation over the phone with O2 who could not find or access it, I took it into an O2 store who advised me to cancel it as that SIM and Mobile Broadband does not work where I live. I had checked the coverage checker before I bought it but was told that was the anticipated coverage after the upgrade was rolled out, their internal map told a different story. I cancelled it there and then while I was in store. My only option is a wired connection which I have now bought. I then contacted Amazon.co.uk 8 days ago under the A-Z Guarantee thinking this was a crystal clear case of cancelling in the cooling off period. I cancelled in the cooling off period in writing. It is in Amazon messages. What is there to argue about. Give me my refund. But no. I find that they say the decision is 7 days. THEN, if you add any details or chase because it is a simple case, THEY RESTART THE 7-DAY CLOCK. We are now on day 8 and as I chased/added proof, it will now be a minimum of 15 days until a decision and I cant chase before as it will restart the clock. Why will it take 15 days to 'decide' whether I can have my £620 back when the service does not work and I cancelled in the cooling off period. Even when I put in the claim over the phone, it was not actually filed the first time. I am not sure if this is deliberate to get rid of the semi-serious claimants but after I did not get an email confirming my £620 refund, I called again and found it had never been filed. i was told not to worry the second time, but then got a huge email requiring me to report this as a theft to the police and it went on and on. It seems the claim that was filed was filed incorrectly on my behalf saying i had not received it, then someone at Amazon took the agent's  filing as the version to work from and out of the blue introduced that looking at my messages about cancelling in the cooling off period and the agents filing, the item must have been stolen, and then proceeded to design a prolonged and convoluted way forward which involved reporting to the police and uploading the reports and it went on and on. This is just to delay the inevitable - whether I have to take Amazon or the seller to court as it was Amazon I found and used the seller from, and Amazon's A-Z guarantee that gives you false commitment to safety of your purchase. They are ACTUALLY trying to get the seller to keep my £620 for providing something that does not work and something I cancelled in the cooling off period in writing through their system so they can see. The A-Z Guarantee is not actually a guarantee that your money is safe. This is causing me so much stress. My mother has just died and I cant even communicated about her funeral service without getting dressed and driving for miles to get to an area I can use the internet. I sent them proof I have bought into a full fibre wired connection now as that is the only thing that will work. Still no response. I want to upload a no internet screenshot I took from home but funnily enough, I cant. Do not trust the A-Z Guarantee. Youl could not have a more straightforward case than mine. The service provider themselves told me to cancel as it would not work, I am in the cooling off period, and here we are 8 days later with no expected decision for another week.

US,"I think Amazon has gotten too big for their own britches. Too many mistakes, and they've forgotten the customers that brought this far. Their customer service is based on 'don't let the customer be right. We don't care what happened'.I've had a few botched deliveries lately. This last one, today, 5/29/2024, drove me to write this. I ordered a $95 knife (Spyderco Delica 4), on 5/27/2024. Amazon showed it would be delivered the next day. For the next 2 days, I was notified that there was a delay. I received it today. Kind of. I received a package. Not the knife I ordered and paid for. It was flat. I opened it. It was a piece of rubber in a plastic bag. No idea what it was for. So, I paid $95 for a knife, and received a 25 cent piece of rubber! I went through the return process. Amazon states that I'll receive a refund within 30 days, after they receive the return item. EPIC FAIL! AGAIN! For about the 5th time in 3 months. And, of course, they won't let you talk to a human. I'm getting real sick of this stupid stuff, their 'we don't care' attitude,  and lousy service!",2024,5,May,2024,1,1,0,US

The package was also overnighted by the seller.I received a notification from Amazon that the driver was 10 stops away So I started to pay attention to the stops.Once the driver was three stops away. I stayed in my living room waiting for them to arrive. All of a sudden I receive a message from Amazon stating the package was undeliverable and my ring cam alerted me that someone was outside. I immediately open my door and the driver is pulling off. I waved my hands to stop her but she never stopped. The driver never came to my door. I have a Ring cam and it caught her driving away in her white car. I immediately contacted Amazon through the app they said they would have the package redelivered later on in the day. I also contacted Amazon personally to complain on the driver and let them know what happened. They advised me of the same thing that they would reroute the package to be delivered later on. The package never came. I sat inside all day waiting on this driver. I missed out on a hotel stay that cost me $150 for one night. I’m extremely upset at both the  Amazon driver and Amazon for not having this package delivered on time. I also needed the package before I went out of town and wasted a whole day sitting inside. Amazon customer service advised  me not to leave  and said this they cannot give me a time of delivery. This is not the first time this has happened with my package. ,2024,5,May,2024,7,1,0,US

GB,"It is impossible to obtain a truthful response from the Amazon customer service team, and there is no avenue to escalate the issue and file an official complaint. I am frustrated with the constant lies I am told whenever an item goes missing or is delivered late. Yesterday, I ordered scattering urns for my parents' ashes, with an expected delivery time between 1.30 and 3.30 pm today.  When I checked the tracking information, it showed the driver parked near my house without any movement for hours. Upon contacting customer service through live chat, I was assured that the items were still out for delivery, despite evidence to the contrary. After speaking with multiple representatives, I was given conflicting information about the delivery attempt. Ultimately, I was informed that the item would still be delivered, but it was already late in the evening and unlikely to arrive today. To my dismay, the delivery date was suddenly changed to the 29th of May. This is not the first time such issues have occurred, and despite promises of refunds for the inconvenience, I have never received them. It seems that Amazon's customer service team protects each other, as there is no effective way to lodge a complaint against them. Unfortunately, it appears that sharing my negative experiences on review platforms like Trustpilot will not result in any action being taken. So I’m probably wasting my time writing this review as nothing will happen as usual ",2024,5,May,2024,3,1,0,GB
US,"The last person i spoke with was very rude, and was basically telling me that it's my fault that my order was delivered messed up. I ordered the shorts needing them for an event tomorrow, but they were delivered today ripped. So, now not only do i have to go out spend more money to buy more, and even told her i didn't want or need the refund that i still want the shorts only to be told that a replacement was unavailable and that i need to send in the shorts and wait for them to be received processed before i can be refunded, so i simply asked are you kidding me then she wants to get an attitude saying no she isn't kidding and that it can take 30 days or more to get them processed for a refund i still even asked if there was any way possible for me to get my refund into my Ammazon gift card balance so that i could order another pair to which she was again rude as hell saying no i had to not only wait the 30 plus days for the refund to be issued but i have to wait another 10 days for it to go back to my card. So, satisfied sadly after this refund is processed i will no longer bee ordering anything from Amazon again, and i took screen shots of the conversation and how rude this person was and i will be on every platform i can find leaving reviews about this. So, not only did Amazon lose me as a customer today but they also lost everyone of my family members and friends that use Amazon. We will be ordering from TikTok shop and ebay from now on. TikTok shop usually has better prices and neither one of them have ever been rude like this to me before and never have i ever had something delivered to me ripped up and i get blamed basically for it and get told I'm basically screwed on getting my money back for a month and a half. I have only had one package come messed up from another place and i contacted customer support and they gave me a choice of getting refunded or i could have the same thing i ordered mailed out that day, to wait on my money for a month and a half is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable especially when it's either Amazon's fault or the delivery company THEY USED to have my order delivered. I guess you guys at Amazon forget that us customers are the ones that keep you employed and for you to treat your customers that spend alot of money with you the way you treated me is beyond crazy. But hey losing around 10-15 prime customers in one day is no sweat for y'all even though one single person is the one that made these 10-15 prime customers leave.

CA,"I decided to share my experience in dealing with Amazon, especially it’s negative flows. 1. There is no transparency from some vendors, especially from China, about return policy and shipping. I had to deal a few times with situations when the company claims their merchandise is refundable, but in fact they want you to pay for the return out of your own pocket! This is SCAM!! 2. Encountered problems with ordering dog’s treats and supplements. Dog treats were extremely dry and old! The supplements came EXPIRED and total ignore from the company to my complains and no refund!! 😡😡 “No refund on pets supplements “ message was only was provided when I tried to return it. THIS IS ALSO SCAM!!! 😡😡3. Like probably for many other people, I find that some prices are much higher than in stores for identical products! 4. I’m sick and tired to see unreasonably high “delivery” fees added to the price tag! This is again especially true for the Chinese vendors. 5. I find it that delivery home, here in Toronto, is disgusting!! Our camera captured a few time like delivery men toss the packages to the ground instead of carefully placing it. Noteworthy to mention how they take the pictures when they leave the package near your door. Once they sent my son a picture of a completely wrong package with a computer keyboard. The picture captured square type of box, where the keyboard no way could have even fit it. The actual package has NEVER arrived!! Once in Toronto a delivery man text me that he couldn’t find my address (😱🙄) and gave me only 5 min to respond back. They obviously don’t think and don’t care, that a person may not see a text within 5 min or be unavailable. I got a feeling he even didn’t try to delivered as it was a day after some minor snowfall! For delivery they ask for any “special instructions”; mine was “please ALWAYS ring the bell!” No, they don’t bother and don’t care that thefts are not only possible, but are very common now! 6. The worse thing of all, that if you encounter any problem, there is no one to contact to resolve an issue immediately or even EVER!! This company obviously DOES NOT CARE about customers satisfaction!!! They are blinded by all the money they get from us, yet treat people without any due respect!! 7. Amazon encounters very serious PROBLEMS SECURING CUSTOMERS’ PERSONAL INFORMATION and this is a NO-NO!! 😡😡🙏I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with many business and customer service aspects of this company and will STOP or drastically REDUCE my dealing to the necessary minimum!

CA,"Just like others, we traditionally have great experiences ordering from Amazon; however, when we wrote a review about their sales/shipping practices, Amazon refused to post it, citing ""doesn't meet community guidelines."" The only part of the review Amazon could be referring to, is that we indicated that Amazon permits sellers to charge shipping fees for a product that Amazon warehouses ship for free - let me clarify that. If the seller has product in stock, ""they"" ship it and charge a delivery fee. If they do not have it in stock, but Amazon has it in their warehouse, Amazon ships it directly, with no delivery fee added. Yeah, that sounds totally backwards, but that was the information we received from Amazon Customer Service. We stated in our review that this is not a ""customer first"" approach, because Amazon does not clearly notify the buyer about this practice. I guess Amazon does not like ""truths"" being posted within reviews on their own website. Amazon used to be the best ""big business"" company for customer service, but they have slowly and steadily become a ""money first"" entity. Need more proof?

The last customer rep I talked with was Dewong today between 5 and 6 MST. Below is my issue:Amazon has been double charging or in some cases charging up to four times the amount of my EBT orders. I found this out when I was on vacation two weeks ago. I have checked all my expenditures in my food stamp account for at least a year. This has happened probably 30 to 50 times charging me anywhere from 2-4 times the same amount in my EBT account, usually on the same day but at different times. I have tried to resolve these overcharges with customer service but to no avail. There may be a government website that I can contact because of fraudulent charges on my EBT card. I have proof of all these transactions.  Amazon does not let you file an online review of their company on their website.  They will take reviews of any of the products you purchased, but nowhere does it let you make any comments about their company.Amazon truly doesn't seem to care about its customers.  It is ridiculous they are trying to rob the EBT customers, EBT customers are the ones who are already in dire straights financially.I will be glad to update this issue if it gets resolved.  Perhaps it is a glitch in their system, but this should not be happening and needs to be addressed.  I would love to hear from other customers who have had this problem.  Still looking for a resolution.I just reviewed many of the other complaints of other users, I understand their complaints, I have had many of the same issues that they are talking about, like customer reps lying to them, it not being easy to contact them, I am not their customer, delivering to the incorrect address, etc., I have heard it all from their customer service if you can get hold of them.",2024,5,May,2024,3,1,0,US

GB,"I recently ordered several items from Amazon, to be delivered by Evri.  The items were due to be delivered a few days ago, then I got a message from Evri saying that they tried to deliver but couldn't because access to our house was blocked.  This was untrue.  I was at home all day and no delivery van appeared, and the access to our house is always clear.  I looked on my Amazon order page, and it advised me to contact Evri.  I really tried to do this.  There is no option on Evri's site to speak to a human being, so I left a message on their chatbot explaining the problem.  They didn't reply, but instead left me a message saying they had tried to deliver again and still couldn't.  This is nonsense.  Whoever they are trying to deliver to, it's not to our address.  On my Amazon account it now says that Evri have paused the delivery until I contact them with more information.  What information?! And how am I supposed to do this, when they won't talk to me?!!Instead I contacted Amazon customer service and asked for a refund for the items.  The agent told me that they couldn't request a refund until the following day, so he would phone me back today.  Today he sent me an email saying he can't get through on my number, I don't know why, and that I need to call Amazon back.  I did this, and the line was so bad I could barely hear the lady I was trying to explain the problem to.  She said she would process a refund.  Later I looked at my Amazon account to check the status of the items, and there was no change, so I phoned back to check that the refund had been requested.  I was told that it hadn't, and that it will be done now and will be in my bank account next week. After all the problems, I have little faith that it will happen.  I have wasted hours trying to resolve this and I am at my wit's end.  It is absurd and not good enough.

Guess what? My review doesn't meet community standards! Amazon doesn't want any reviews to pertain to the seller, which is ridiculous, since the package was tampered with, the safety seal on the outside of the box had been slit open, the package had originally contained 3 bottles, not just one, and the worst, the bottle itself had no safety seal, and someone had access to the supplements before shipping.

Remember this was an ""Indian CSR"".Just now, i had problem with an order; it was elligable for partial refund; when i talked with a CSR, an english speaking lady picked up and she was very polite and gentle and told me that i am elligable for 40-45% partial refund; i wanted to talk with my wife for the decision so i thanked her and hung up; after that i called again and this time an Indian CSR picked up and he plainly told me that i am elligable for only 30% refund; and i was like ""whattt"" and i told him that just now i spoken with a CSR and she told me that i had 40-45 % refund; hearing this the Indian guy simply got confused and told me that its a ""special refund"" and that he will see that i am elligable; after some time he said that ok i am elligable for ""special refund"".So guys be aware, keep on calling AMAZON CSRs until you met with an English speaking person, they seem to have ""more morality"" than the Indian CSRs.",2024,5,May,2024,1,1,0,US

Since you could only order 4 pair of any colour at the same time, I also placed multiple orders.On the Amazon website it stated that these socks were all to be delivered within a week or maximum 14 days to the Netherlands.I received the largest part of my orders within 14 days, however Amazon could not ship 8 pair of socks at that time and I was given an indication of another 2-3 weeks for delivery.After waiting patiently for these socks for 3 weeks, I received a message from Amazon (the day before these socks were set to be shipped) that they were cancelling the order.I contacted the Amazon helpdesk to ask what happened. They told me the colour could not be found in the warehouse and therefore they would cancel my order. I asked them if it would be possible to get a different colour (at the time of ordering multiple other colours were also available for the promotional price).After some discussion Amazon agreed to sell me 8 pair of socks in a colour of my choice. They even promissed me an additional discount of 10% and refund of the shipping costs because of all the hassle.They told me I had to cancel my orders and order these socks at the current price. They would than refund me the difference in price once I received the orders, as well as the 10% discount and the shipping costs.To make sure I understood correctly I even send them a calculation of what refund the would be giving me (the price was more than double compared to the promotional price). They confirmed I understood everything correctly and I wouldn't have to worry.So I ordered 8 pair of socks and send Amazon an message to receive the refund. However, Amazon refused to give me the promised refund.I have had long message conversations as well as 2 phone calls for over an hour with the help desk. During these calls the Amazon employees agreed with me and promised me to arrange the refund.

US,"*Disappointing Amazon Purchase Experience*I recently had a frustrating experience with an item I purchased from Amazon, sold by a third-party vendor called LAFIYA US. While the outer bubble packaging appeared undamaged upon delivery, the product itself inside was in an unacceptable condition. It was torn apart and crudely held together with masking tape.This shoddy state of the item has severely diminished my view of Amazon as a reputable retailer. And just two years ago, I had spent nearly $10,000 on computer parts (to build for Custom Fully Water-cooled PC) through their platform without any issues. However, this recent incident has made me reconsider being an Amazon customer going forward.What I find most disheartening is that Amazon would allow questionable vendors likeLAFIYA US to operate on their marketplace while selling non-returnable items in such poor condition. Despite being just a $20 purchase, the fact that Amazon would permit this kind of subpar seller experience after my substantial patronage over the years is truly disappointing and discouraging.",2024,5,May,2024,28,1,0,US

US,"VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL FAIR TRADE COMPETITION LAW The FTC and states allege Amazon’s anticompetitive conduct occurs in two markets—the online superstore market that serves shoppers and the market for online marketplace services purchased by sellers. These tactics include:Anti-discounting measures that punish sellers and deter other online retailers from offering prices lower than Amazon, keeping prices higher for products across the internet. For example, if Amazon discovers that a seller is offering lower-priced goods elsewhere, Amazon can bury discounting sellers so far down in Amazon’s search results that they become effectively invisible.Conditioning sellers’ ability to obtain “Prime” eligibility for their products—a virtual necessity for doing business on Amazon—on sellers using Amazon’s costly fulfillment service, which has made it substantially more expensive for sellers on Amazon to also offer their products on other platforms. This unlawful coercion has in turn limited competitors’ ability to effectively compete against Amazon.Amazon’s illegal, exclusionary conduct makes it impossible for competitors to gain a foothold. With its amassed power across both the online superstore market and online marketplace services market, Amazon extracts enormous monopoly rents from everyone within its reach.

US,"There seem to be two weights and measures for setting up shop with Amazon.com. One for the local (read: American) people and one for the international (read: Chinese) sellers.I recently helped someone local setting up an Amazon Seller’s Account. What a tedious, strenuous experience. Lots of documents and information required: driver license, proof of residency, bank and credit card details, business address, description and references, verified phone numbers and email addresses, name of business owners, company representative, nationality, etc…etc…etc…I understand, Amazon is protecting its brand and wants to weed out bogus operations to protect itself and sellers, right?Well, I got a big surprise when I had to contact Amazon concerning a failing product sold by a third party vendor (read: Chinese).(1) impossible to contact the seller directly, no information about the seller is listed. Only the name is provided (let’s say ABC)(2) contacting the seller is only possible through the Messaging Assistant who states: “I send your message to ABC”. Since no response from seller is received, I contacted Customer Service Support for help getting in contact with the vendor directly.And here it gets juicy. The Agent also did not find any contact information about seller ABC. Agent escalated the question higher up to a Lead Agent who came back empty handed. No information is available about company ABC.How is that possible? Since I experienced personally how though the vetting procedure is to set up shop on the Amazon platform and all the verified contact details that needed to be provided before a sellers account can be opened, here is a third party vendor (read: Chinese) company ABC selling on the Amazon website and nobody knows how to get in contact with them.In the meantime and that because of the staggering complains about their faulty product(s), company ABC changed its name into XYZ apparently without any scrutiny by Amazon. That way, company XYZ does not need to reply to complains about products it did not sell. They keep selling same unsound products using same templates on the Amazon portal. It’s obvious that the screening by Amazon is non-existing. Corporate greed towers above buyer’s protection. Permission is given to Chinese companies who can distribute their cheaper but faulty products to us and unaware Americans are left behind holding the bag. Time to wake up people!

Picture this: I'm locked out of my account because, surprise, surprise, I no longer have access to my phone number. So, what's Amazon's brilliant solution? Use a credit card. Sounds straightforward, right? Wrong! Apparently, the geniuses at Amazon haven't yet grasped the concept of credit card expiration dates.In my quest to untangle this mess, I attempted to reach out to their esteemed customer service. But alas, the phone numbers provided might as well have led to the Bermuda Triangle, because they were utterly useless from my corner of the world in New Zealand.It's mind-boggling that a company swimming in cash like Scrooge McDuck hasn't managed to figure out basic customer service protocols. And so, in a fit of exasperation, I was forced to resort to the drastic measure of creating a whole new account just to make a simple purchase. Bravo, Amazon, for turning what should've been a routine transaction into a Shakespearean tragedy of errors.

NL,"My nightmare with amazon customer service started off a few days before Christmas when I ordered a gift for my parents. A few days after placing the order, I checked my letterbox on my way back from work to find that my package from Amazon had been delivered to my neighbours, however, it was not specified which neighbours the package was delivered to. Bear in mind, I live in an apartment block with over 100 residents. So I put up a sign on the entrance asking if anyone has received my package to please contact me. I also contacted amazon asking them where my package is exactly. Consequently, Amazon launched an investigation with the courier and found that there is no further information as to where the package was delivered and as a result starts a refund process. So far so good. However, after waiting for more than a full week, I still did not receive my refund and there are no further updates from Amazon. Therefore, I called customer service, spelled out my unbelievably long university email about 3 times before they got it right for them to check what the refund status was. They then assured me that all is in order and that I will receive my money soon. Nevertheless, days passed and I still did not receive a refund. So I decided to call again. After giving the customer service worker all my details they told me that my account had been blocked due to an outstanding payment on Amazon.es, although I live in Germany and order from Amazon.de. Therefore, the refund has also been blocked. As a result, they escalated the issue and promised me that I would receive my money as this outstanding order nonsense made no sense. Nevertheless, a week went by and my bank account was still 160 euros short. Consequently, I called a third time to ask what the situation was. Bear in mind, each time I call I have to explain my situation from the beginning and carry out the verification procedure of repeating my long and complex email address and home address. After explaining my situation, customer service once again told me that they have made a mistake and that my refund will be issued. Nevertheless, the EXACT same thing happened as last time. I didn't hear back from them for days and my refund never arrived. At this point I am 3 calls and several emails in with absolutely no progress.Subsequently, I called a fourth time to figure out what the hell was going on. This time I was forwarded to someone higher up in the customer service rankings. After almost one hour on the phone, the lady assured me that she would tend to the issue herself. Once this has been done, she would call me back with the final outcome. It was already 630 pm after work when the call was coming to an end. Nevertheless, she told me that she was working until midnight and would call me back before then. So I literally stayed awake until midnight waiting for a call which never arrived. At this point I really wanted to give up but it is a lot of money for me so I checked my emails 2 days later only to see that my account has been unblocked but there is no sign of a refund. As a result, I called a 5th time now. This time I insisted on a solution on the spot. After almost an hour on the call and the customer service employee talking to his superiors while I was on hold, I was told that the final decision is that no refund will be issued. Well, let me explain their logic. Apparently, a one time pickup code was issued to me and given to the courier. Long story short, I got screwed over almost 200 euros for no reason, be careful with Amazon.",2024,5,December,2023,7,1,0,NL

In July of last year, I purchased Natures Aid DHA Omega-3 Mini Drops for Infants and Children. Just this week, I received an email stating the product has been recalled due to containing hazardous chemicals!Here's the most disturbing part - my son, who was 19 months old at the time, consumed these drops! Amazon offered a simple refund as compensation. This is absolutely absurd! A refund does not come close to addressing the potential health risks my child may have faced.I am utterly disgusted that Amazon considers a measly £5 sufficient compensation for potentially exposing my child to harmful chemicals. Their response is shockingly dismissive of a very serious situation.This experience raises serious concerns about the safety of products sold on Amazon and their handling of product recalls. Parents trust them with the well-being of their children, and this kind of nonchalant response is completely unacceptable.Other parents, please be aware! Check your cupboards for these recalled drops and take immediate action to protect your child's health. Furthermore, I urge Amazon to take product safety and recalls much more seriously.

You can only say nice things regardless of the number of stars you give. They are a bunch of scum and after spending tens of thousands of dollars on their website they have blocked me for warning people against  Biologically dangerous crap that some of these people sell on these websites disguised as supplements.

I spoke to amazon about the order and they said I could not request a new product but they would refund my money in 5-7 days. 5-7 days later I get a refund for $289.98.

I've used the visual and audio etc, and it never stops and never completes the process even though I've continuously input correctly. I've tried to contact customer service and yet that continuously goes around in circles too, leading me back to the repetitive process that never ends.I have products on amazon.au and tried to contact them to find out why they have deliberately increased the pricing to 3 times the amount than I nominated. For example, a book in paperback is higher than the hardcover of the same title. Why would they do that to a producer of a product and certainly discourage a sale for the most popular customer preference. The fact I cannot get past log in process and they blatantly make it impossible to question why they have nominated to make a producers product pricing questionable does really spell a lack of transparency for the company. When it comes down to me being a customer, the site is certainly losing sales from me and for the sellers because they don't make it easy to log in to an account to make a purchase. Poor form and very unprofessional.P.S, It does make me question their selling tactics. Do they have staff on retainers or commission who also sell their own products on the site? Therefore, pushing their own products to make sales above all other sellers and do their staff have a place in listing other sellers product pricing, only to cause a dire affect to deter customers from purchasing thus the other sellers products which would only give advantage to the staff products being reasonably priced to influence sales for themselves.I know of another site that I have become very familiar with over the past 5 years who are doing the same thing and it became obvious by their marketing emails with the same old artists products being in the emails, high up in search on the site, and always in the artists spotlight.

US,"Amazon customer service is the worst I’ve ever experienced, or, I should say, has become that. This year marks the worst so far, and it’s only April. Nobody trains the agents what to do except lie, or they do not understand what you say to them. You can even water it down so anyone could understand it but they're always lost. At the beginning of the year, I had to update my phone number. It took a month of working with the BBB to even attempt that. A billion agents each telling something asinine, thinking I’d believe it being they made constant assurances that never go anywhere. They are surely trained in that.I had to give them my blacked-out ID to merely update a bloody phone number that was easier with my bank, pharmacy and post office. After all, this whole country is based on phone numbers and codes when not involving targeted ads. The former is what finally after almost a month got my number updated after all their insanely ridiculous replies to the BBB case, which shows how dense and clueless they are. It sadly gets worse.That same month, I received two items damaged beyond repair. An agent two months ago said there was no need to return the item. I have screenshots. If you mention this, they seemingly panic and lie some more. Weirdly, there are screenshots, but the mere mention of such things sends them into a frenzy. The agents in turn assure more things which they never bothered to do, like a refund for one. Two months later, I received  an email to return the item I was told to never send back. Screenshots tell the truth. They naturally took the money out after saying that if you’re charged, meaning you will be, we will reimburse you. They took it out twice.  Another agent said he fixed it and issued it, but there was no confirmation email. More screenshots. Always take them, or they’ll just lie some more. Of course, in essence it’s all they do when not assuring it is fixed and leads to more issues. I thought to check if the refund even went through two days later, but I never received a confirmation email, so I merely engaged to check. An hour later, I was promised four months of free Prime because the other agent lied about issuing a refund just two days earlier. I found out from the third agent during one chat alone (many get lost and transfer to another sometimes even more lost) for a simple issue (checking the status of non-existent and promised refunds). Amazon also conveniently and quite stupidly have no reference or ticket numbers for any chat so future agents won’t be as lost as they always are. Lovely. This agent was as nice as most are, but clearly in over his head. I took billions of screenshots, but I am fearful all the promises will lead to more chats from hell. I know nobody wants to work there since Rocket Boy is so cheap; there’s nothing worse than the people working there. 2024 has already been an absolute nightmare.  Always use chat so you can get screenshots of these fake promises. The emails have no reference numbers, as is now policy so ask for chat transcripts. Good luck in getting concrete answers for anything, as it’s all assurances to seem nice while they mislead you, or outright lie until you get the next lying agent.

US,"I have mostly had good luck with Amazon over the years, but it's my most recent experiences that have me not ""smiling"".I recently ordered a new set of Sony surround speakers that were part of a renovation of what we call our ""sunroom"". When the ""new"" speakers arrived, one of the main tower speakers and the set of two Atmos ceiling-directed speakers were obvious returns. The tower speaker was without the soft foam ""sock"" that keeps it from being scratched and the Atmos speakers were carelessly wrapped in the soft foam (hanging half off) plus there were the remains of speaker wires being previously attached. I sent the tower speaker back to get another one and Amazon would only do a credit to the account and not a refund. I kept the Atmos speakers as they seem to work ok, but I felt cheated. These items should have been sold as ""warehouse"" items at a reduced price. New is new and not kind-of new and we pay a premium price for that privilege. The most recent problem was with a lightening arrester that I needed. I bought an item that would work with standard coax used by satellite and cable companies but received an item that was for larger coax. I sent it back for another one only to get the same wrong item. I'm now dealing directly with the producer of the item who is correcting the situation.After having the problem myself, I have since read where others have experienced the same problems. To add to the problem, Amazon has made it impossible to find and actual contact phone number where you can talk to a human to right things.

The door was unlocked, I was home, and up at 5:08 AM.

They simply said SORRY, we will try again tomorrow. (It was supposed to be delivered yesterday, What happened to today?)I asked the customer service rep to give me the number to the carrier.

It really sucks because your service is really bad. I never got any of my products that I ordered so I canceled everything. The GPS came up as the delivery guy going into the circle in front of my house and then saying oh I have a few more deliveries then when I go to him and ask him where my delivery is, he said I don’t even have it on my truck, you have to order something in order for us to deliver really Every time I order something I never get it delivered right they either leave it in the damn driveway or they just don’t deliver it at all and they don’t even put it on a truck but then say it was on a truck and ready for delivery, but it never comes. Everyone around me gets their damn package except for me. They always skip my house for some reason or another. The service from Amazon is the worst that you can ever get I will not be ordering again from Amazon and I order a lot. You’ve lost me as a customer.

GB,"Had so many problems with Amazon that I will no longer use them, even though I have outstanding items to be delivered. I purchased an Apollo biscuit tin and returned it, due to its cheapness, with another item - both items in the same box. Unfortunately, I did not complete the paperwork - address label, instructions etc., due to a lapse in forgetfulness (age related). Therefore used the label from the Flexzion Teapot that went on the box for the both items not realising this was for two different addresses one for Amazon and the other a third party seller. As far as I am concerned if it's on the Amazon website then regardless of third party or not it's going back to Amazon. This problem has been bouncing around since the end of March 2024. Just spoken to someone in Customer Services (another person appearing to be helpful but not) and that is the main problem 2 different addresses. Apparently unless Amazon or the seller send this item back to me (very doubtful because of the label situation ) I can then send to the correct party I won't get my refund of £15.95! This may seem a very small amount but I am in my seventies with serious illnesses and on a fixed budget.

(Hence another problem: they are VERY slow to solve your issues.) This is common sense in a retail/customer service business. Must have dummies managing this company.

The item itself was completely damaged, with scratches and dents all over. It was as if they’d played football with it during shipping.Vendor’s Response: I immediately contacted the seller, hoping for a quick resolution. But guess what? They refused to provide an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization). Can you believe it? A damaged product, and they wouldn’t even acknowledge it. Their customer service was nonexistent.Amazon’s Stance: I thought Amazon would have my back, but nope! They sided with the vendor. Apparently, they’re more concerned about keeping their sellers happy than ensuring customer satisfaction. It’s like they’re saying, “Hey, buyer, tough luck!”No Accountability: The lack of accountability from both the vendor and Amazon is appalling. I’m left with a broken product, a dent in my wallet, and a bitter taste in my mouth.Final Verdict: Avoid VanAcc Store at all costs.

This second date also passed, with no shoes and no further tracking info avaliable. I waited for a while, but then I reached out to customer serive by chat. I was told the item seemed to be lost or stolen along the way. I was asked to get new shoes. However, I was starting to be in a hurry for the date when I needed the shoes, and with normal delivery, I would not get them in time. I was then offered free express shipping. I was told i had to pay for it, but when the item arrived I was told to contact customer support again for a refund for the expenses of the express shipping. I was also told the chat would be stored so that i did not have to tell the whole story again. As this was promised to me, I aggreed to have the shoes sent another time, with express shipping. This time the item reached me as it was supposed to. I then contacted customer service again, but the person i got to talk to then, knew nothing about it. I had to explain everything all over again, and in the end I was told some other department or whatever had to handle it, and they would contact me within a day or so. I heard nothing from anyone after that. So now I tried again, as I am still missing the refund for the cost of the express shipping. I would not have bought the shoes otherwice, and at this point I would have been able to buy the shoes somewhere else for less.

US,"I can't begin to describe how far Amazon has fallen over the years.  I was a customer from the beginning.  I was with Prime shortly after it came out.  I seriously thought it was the best company in the world, until it wasn't.  Then it wasn't even close.  Amazon now has among the worst customer service I encounter anywhere.  It rivals Comcast and Verizon Fios for the worst service you can even conceive of.  There's literally no way to describe the thousand ways Amazon fails at basic stuff.  It's service is a nightmare now.  You're sent off to a foreign country, with people who are supremely unhelpful, with the simplest issues taking hours to resolve.  I'm over it.  I no longer trust Amazon.  It's that simple.  Most recent case in point: I called Synchrony Bank, the issuer of the Amazon store card, to pay my bill.  It said the balance was over $400, so I thought I'd go through to a live person and see what the purchases were, to make sure nothing was unauthorized.  I recognized every purchase, except one.  There was an $11 charge for Amazon digital services.  I knew I hadn't authorized any digital purchases, so told them to put me through to Amazon.  The Indian man I spoke with was completely unhelpful.  Mind you, I mean him or anyone else no disrespect for being foreign.  He spoke with a thick accent likely because English was his second language.  GOOD FOR HIM.  It's something to be proud of.  But it also makes it very difficult to take care of issues that have any degree of complexity at all. He insisted I definitely ordered Amazon Music Unlimited, because I played [unintelligible] on my Alexa device.  What was the name of it?  ""It was [unintelligible]""  HUH?  SAY THAT AGAIN SLOWLY?  Literally, his accent was so thick I couldn't tell at all what he was saying.  After repeating it a fourth time, I made out the word ""noise.""  It hit me that Amazon was charging me $11 a month to play ""brown noise"" on my bedroom Alexa device.  I've played that as a background sleep noise for YEARS.  Didn't start in December.  I've literally played it for about 3-5 years, every single night.  Suddenly it apparently started charging me for it in December.  I never heard it ask me ANYTHING about a subscription and certainly never agreed to any such thing.  But that didn't convince this Amazon rep, who apparently could read my mind and insisted I absolutely did order it.  I grew increasingly annoyed, especially as he kept going silent for 20, 30, 40 seconds at a time without saying a word, no hold or anything.. just silence.  Finally I told him, ""why are you being silent?  I don't know what you're doing.""  He then hung up on me.  So much for customer service.  I called angrier now and spoke with a second rep.  She was so very sorry the first rep hung up on me.  If I would just take more time out of my Saturday night to explain everything all over again and verify myself again... which I had no choice but to do.  She took a complaint on the last rep, but said she couldn't help me.  I'd have to be transferred to Amazon music.  Mind you, by this time it's nearly 1 am in the morning on a Sunday morning.  She puts me on hold... and I wait and I wait and wait some more.  About 15 minutes she comes back and says ""I'm sorry for the long wait.  I'm still in the queue to speak with Amazon music.""  I told her I would wait.  She puts me back on hold... 20 minutes pass... 30 minutes pass... 40 minutes pass.  Finally I had to give up.  She never came back on the line to say anything.  Just the same canned music playing over and over and over and over on a loop.  Called again.  Asked for a supervisor, but my phone died because I'd been held on the line so long.  He didn't call back.  I gave up because I had to give up.  Otherwise, I'd have a stroke from my anger and high blood pressure.  Amazon, you suck. Every single time I have a problem now, this is what I encounter.  Amazon is no longer a great company.  It's a company that will cut every corner, that disrespects its customers and their time, and that cares only about its bottom line.  It will go the way of Sears because it deserves to.

When I was eventually advised to return the incorrectly delivered item with a picture accompanying it for the refund to be processed (and the return form specifically said, return the incorrectly delivered item), the refund has not been processed and another customer service rep is advising that they need to send me a mail to gather further information - on top of the many mails that have already been sent on this matter!!! This is Amazon trying to frustrate customers out of having to pay for either their own mistake or fraud. I would strongly advise not ordering an  expensive item from Amazon that you can't afford to take a hit on if they don't deliver the correct item. Absolutely shocking customer service. I am a long loyal customer of Amazon (which my account shows if the customer service reps would be bothered to check it) and up to now we have had no issues with Amazon service but the treatment in this case has been woeful with customer service reps just trying to push the problem along without resolving it.

Amazon do not do what they say they will do and that is deliver on time. Judging by the ratings, I clearly am not the only one who is disappointed with this service. ",2024,4,April,2024,42,1,0,GB
GB,"Was a Prime member for years until recently because I'm fed up mainly with customer service and the constant lying/false information.Returning an item is completely inconsistent where sometimes it will be less than a week and some times over a month with constant back and forth between customer service web chat and phone calls.... Currently waiting on a £232 refund for an item that has been sat at their returns center for 3 days now with no update. I was relying on this refund to pay bills, get food, electricity etc but nope... Holding my refund until they see fit regardless of them confirming they've received the item.  Take my money instantly but make me wait a month for it back. It's not even like I have a history of scamming with Amazon, every single on of my returns have been sound and refunded but whenever it's anything over £100 it takes this long. Once and IF I eventually get my refund, I'm not buying anything from Amazon again and I'm leaving out Prime. I'm done with the rude customer service who constantly lie and close the webchat before I even get a chance to respond. Being told one thing by one rep then told something completely different by another and that the last person was wrong and shouldn't have said that. ",2024,4,April,2024,1,2,0,GB

Gave box back to driver and called customer service right away. Was told that item was still in delivery mode even as I watch driver send message that package was empty. Talked to customer service people and supervisors, both about as useful as a tick on ones back side. Neither seemed to care about the fact that I was stuck eleven hundred miles away from home nor that it was costing me money because they hired a thief in their employment. Now waiting for a replacement, have been waiting all day too late to have item install, more money wasted. Wonder if Bazo would have this issue. Had I known this would have happened I would have dealt with E-Bay and got better results.

And I want to make you aware of this just in case it has happened to you. I noticed an unauthorised payment going out of my bank account to Amazon.com, now I have been a prime member with Amazon.Co.uk since 2011 and I have spent a lot of money with them. Now I contacted Amazon.Co.uk customer service regarding this unauthorised payment, they told me because the account was set up with Amazon.com. That it was Amazon.com that I had to contact, which I did so I explained to them the details of the payment. And I also told that this payment dated back to July 2018, so everyone please check your bank accounts and make sure that they haven’t set up a bogus account whereby you are paying them a monthly subscription by either paying it to Amazon.com or Amazon.Co.uk. Now as I have mentioned I have been paying for something that I have never used, and the payment has amounted up to £700+, the account was set up via a visa payment. Now I will give them a little bit of credit, because after contacting them they have paid me back 22 months. But I have be paying for the subscription for a total of 81 months, but if they can pay me back for some of the money. Why can’t they pay me back the full amount, now during the passed few years I have been of ill health due to becoming disabled and been on a lot of medication which has had an impact on my mental health and I am more or less sure that if I would of had my facilities I would of picked up on this pay sooner rather than later. All this has been explained to them, but they are telling me that there system will only allow them to go back so far. And that there system won’t allow them to be able to generate a payment no further than the 22 months. I have spoke to Amazon.com via there chat room so that I have got some kind of record of what has been said, and I have also been in contact with them via telephone calls. If they had decided to reimburse me the full amount, I will be perfectly honest with you. I don’t think that I would be writing this review, but I am glad in a way that they haven’t paid me back the full amount. Because it has given me the chance to make you all aware of What Amazon are capable of doing now I am hitting a brick wall, now I have never read any of your reviews and I can see now how bad Amazon are being run.

Got a different TV antenna cost $60.00 bucks also did not work and said I didn’t like it. Then I get in other of a TV antenna cost $200.00 and nothing less Chanel so i say  the product sucks. They blocked me in got offended. So I was hones with my review as well as with the positive review. So freedom of speech is definitely not allowed in a company I am paying for your salary .

GB,"Amazon driver was delivering to houses on my road. Parked his van fully across my driveway so that I could not get my car out. I was going out and needed to use my car and asked him to move so I could exit my driveway and he ignored me.  I told him to move immediately and he began walking to me and swearing aggressively. I ran to my front door and told him I was going to call the police and he threatened to ""bust your head in"". I had photos and immediately telephoned Amazon and also sent emails to the CEO and my MP. Amazon customer service replied and said they would telephone the next day but they never did. Instead they sent an email saying they called and did not get any answer, but they LIED because I did not receive any call. I have asked them to telephone so that they can investigate the matter and take action against the aggressive driver but they  still have not called. The driver was threatening and abusive so I have taken legal advice and contacted the police.  I am a woman and literally living in fear that the driver will come back.  If I am killed by their driver then I hope the media/public will report my story so that the driver does not get away with it.

GB,"Amazon security is rubbish. Our family Amazon account has been fully hacked, and our hacker easily managed to change our account phone number, email and password on our Amazon account without a single barrier stopping that hacker. Now our hacker has access to our home address and bank cards in our Amazon account, which is really worrying. We received an email from Amazon that our old email address A has been changed to the new email address B, which was shocking because we never changed our email address. Amazon could have send us a link in that same email to give an option to undo this email change if it wasn't us, something that all big companies have for their customer account like gmail. Or Amazon could have send a code to our phone number or old email address that our hacker needed access to before that hacker could change our account email address or password so basically some sort of security barrier, but clearly Amazon thought that there was no need for any of these barrier even if everyones Amazon account contains peoples bank card and personal details plus our hacker can freely order stuff on our account and properly will do other suspicious acts. Who ever made Amazon website have clearly lacked some simple security standards.

GB,"I am so distressed and upset at the way I have been dealt with by Amazon today. I used to think they were a good company. Not now. My deliveries used to arrive. Not now. So basically I ordered a couple of small items that would have fitted in the mailbox today. I got an email they would be delivered by 9pm. I was out of my apartment for about an hour. When I came back I checked my amazon account and it said my item had been delivered and handed to resident. Which it hadn't. This really annoyed me as it had not been delivered I was not in and it had not been handed to me. I really hate it when a delivery driver says they have handed something to you when they have not as its a complete lie. I live in an apt on the first floor and all I want is for someone to ring my bell and hand me my delivery. This rarely happens. I have written clear delivery instructions which are never read and I've complained before. If I'm not in go to my apt on first floor and leave outside my door. I don't want it thrown outside and I don't want it thrown downstairs in a communal area. I don't what it handed to people that live in other apts that I don't even know. So it takes me ages to find amazon's customer service number. As they keep changing it. Then I've to listen to lots of recorded stuff. The call gets cut off and I phone back. Then I have to go through a painstakingly long process to give my number and my email several times repeating every letter. Then they say there's no account with my email and my number despite me using amazing for years. Then finally then I've to go into my email. I can't understand the person I'm talking to they can't understand me. Why can't amazon employ people in local areas to deal with local issues. It's insanely hard dealing with amazon. I wasted hours today and it's after midnight and I'm still upset. I'm told sorry to hear you didn't receive your item I will help you. Then I'm transferred to some other team logistics or something and I got the rudest woman I've ever encountered on a phone call jia or something I honestly didn't get her name. I really wanted to report her for being absolutely horrific and completely upsetting me. She had zero empathy. I told her I just wanted what I had ordered as I had paid amazon and it was meant to be here. I said just send it next day delivery or give me a refund. She said no they were launching an investigation whatever the hell that means. And you have to wait 3 days! Hold on I've already waited 3 days for delivery and now I've to wait another 3 days. Before I can even get a refund or replacement. Are these jokers for real? With a guy that has lied about giving my parcel to me as I was not physically there. Where the hell do these parcels go? I have a severe back injury and one of the items was to help that and I was going into hospital in a few days I said look please just send out what I ordered. She had zero empathy and just kept taking over me saying only when the investigation has concluded. I said I will be in hospital then. She couldn't care less. I also said well the delivery driver has obviously lied that he handed me the parcel and I can prove I wasn't in. She then kept talking over me very negatively zero empathy and finally hung up! I've actually been in tears over her attitude and it's ruined my day. I phoned back again to complain about her but of course I couldn't as you get through to a call centre that couldn't care less. There's no official customer service team. I go through the whole drawn out process again with a nicer girl this time but still saying no refund no replacement. How is this even legal? Amazon failed to deliver what I paid for and already waited 3 days for. And now I've to wait another 3 days.  I asked to speak to a manager and then it was, the same robotic response our policy is bla bla bla. No human empathy. This is not on. Amazon need to get delivery drivers that deliver and stop telling lies that they have handed you a parcel. I feel like cancelling amazon account and I wish there was a better place I could order from. Thus whole experience has ruined my day. And I've been in tears and stressed out. Now I've to wait for the outcome of an investigation with a delivery driver who has already lied as he didn't hand me the parcel. Amazon sucks and I really dislike this company now and want nothing to do with them. I need the items that I ordered and they told me to order again but there's no guarantee I will get them and I have to wait 3 days if I even get a refund. I don't think this is legal. And Amazon are horrific now. I will be looking into ordering elsewhere. Amazon make out that you're almost not telling the truth or something.

US,"I've been a pretty frequent amazon customer over at least the last two decades. The downfall started with a decision to purchase a macbook pro for around $3000. A large purchase, but I had confidence that if anything went wrong amazon would right things quickly. I received a one time passcode or OTP as they refer to it. I greeted the amazon delivery person, I gave him the passcode several times- he kept repeating it back incorrectly. I took the package and remarked to my girlfriend that man they make macs light these days. I opened the package to find an obviously used and abused macbook box. I opened the box with an ever increasing heart rate as I knew at this point my worst fears were about to be realized. It was EMPTY! My girlfriend rushed out the door to the driver who was just down the street. He stated you want to look in the back of my truck? Nothing I can do, call amazon support. Of course I called right away. I sat on hold for at least 30-40 mins. Amazon's first attempt at resolving the issue was to tell me there was nothing that could be done since I gave them the OTP- they stated I should call the police???!!!! When I refused and stated I had already wasted my day with this whole situation they put me on hold again for many minutes. They finally returned and refunded my order. This person refunded me with the most disgust I've ever experienced in my years of customer service. She quickly said bye, none of the usual thanks for being an amazon customer... Little did I know the issues would only continue from here. Later that evening I received an email stating my account had most likely been hacked and all my orders were cancelled. Next I came to find out that any order around $100+ would require a OTP- meaning they send you a passcode via email a couple hrs before your order arrives that you're forced to give to the delivery person- meaning you have to be present all day long if you actually want to receive your order. That's exactly the opposite of what amazon was designed to be. I called in multiple times to have this obstruction / inconvenience removed. One person from logistics stated maybe I should buy my macbook from apple like he did? I asked if he ever bought anything on amazon for $100+ he stated no. After talking to several more people from all over the world one person agreed to give me a partial refund of around $79 of the $139 I was so exhausted I agreed to it. I now realize that it makes no sense, given it's only almost April 1st and a prorated refund would be $100+??? This has been a pretty ridiculous experience to say the least.

While I appreciate how this can help protect me, this turned into a nightmare experience.I placed an order to send to a friend as a surprise, when the account was suspended, my order containing various individual message was also canceled. I contacted customer service 4 times over the course of 1 week. Continually all agents kept on promising and reassuring me that my account will be reinstated in 24-48 hours as well as my order with each individual message and I was promised a $15 gift card for the trouble. I followed up on my account status 48 hrs after the initial contact and I was told my account is still suspended but it’s not their responsibility to reinstate it instead it was Accounts team. After failing to put me in contact with this team I was asked to grab a pen and paper to call this department myself. I requested a call back instead. The call was promised the same day. 3 days later no contact so I reached out to customer service again to be told again how they can’t do anything about it and should speak to another team. Having spoken to 6 agents over the phone and about 12 in chats I can’t begin to describe my frustration, disappointment and whirlpool of emotions. This last agent told me that there is no way my order can be recovered and that there is no such $15 credit in my account. Confused and upset I’m just speechless about this whole experience.

Avoid dealing with their empty promises and poor quality (both services and goods).PS: there is still no resolution to my problem or any reasonable contact/communication with Amazon.comThe whole thing has literally turned from a computer/model error into a human led poor customer service.

NZ,"Jeff Bezos has the unique privilege on being classified as a rilobber baron alongside many early 20th century figures. Amazon Export Services (AES) employs the cheapest 1* rated companies for international deliveries. It makes it imposdible to record a complaint. It tells a lot of lies on its invoice about how it will handle import processes. In New Zealabd, if your package is worth more than 1000 nzd, for which you have already paid import fees, your package sits in limbo forever. Aramex NZ, which Anazon employs, is a frachisee provider. There is one customs broker who tells a lot of lies about how the the package is due soon, when it has been held by customs for 17days. Mr Azmir Siddiqui (AamirS- his domain name is aramex.com in case you need to put his contact details together) is not inclined to respond to emails. The contact centre is in the phillipines and likely to hang up on you. Aamir is a bottleneck and nothing happens. He probably has too much paperwork in between delivery of 1* rated uber eats. Mr Danny Murphy, supposedluly the Canterbury General Manager of Aramex NZ (1.3* rating only because you cannot rate zero) is uncontactable. This is Amazon for you. The customer can only rate the seller who is not to blame. Customer cannot rate AES. Cunning.",2024,3,March,2024,2,1,0,Other

Who cares if its a truck or my car. The truth is they are saving a TON of money by inconveniencing their customers!!! A return took me 1 min, put it back in the box or bag it came in, print a label, slap it on and drop it in a UPS drop box --any time of the day or night--even midnight if needed. The box is 1 min drive. Now I have to chat with an Amazon representative they email me a label it takes about 20 mins of my time. So RIDICULOUS and beyond maddening!!

Then I noticed that I had a new charge to my bank of $944.99 I called Amazon and was told a refund will be mailed to me in 8 to 10 days so I waited and no check came I called and was told no record of them telling me a refund was coming exsisted. The support staff then told me a check has been processed and to expect it in 8 to 10 weeks which made no sense to me  onsidering that. An get a 200lbs item to my place overnight in most cases bur a envelope that weighs less than 1lbs they need 8 to 10 weeks to deliver.so I called hack because the replacement TV was not only missing parts but was malfunctioning so I finally got them to agree to pick it up for a refund they picked it up Dec 6 2023 I haven't seen a penny back and to top it all off they tried to charge me the $944.99 7 more times each time I've had an nsf fee of $40.00 charged to my account.amazon refund me my $944.99 for the TV and send me $280.00 for fees caused by you attempting to charge me for a TV I bought and already returned. Theyvtold me until their system collects another $944.99 from my account that it will keep charging or trying to charge me that amount their suggestion was that I put another $944.99 in my account let them take it then they will instantly refund it no thanks I just want the $944.99 for the TV and $280.00 for the nsf fees caused so far then you can close my Amazon account,2024,3,March,2024,3,1,0,CA

GB,"- A customer of 8 YearsAs a company in terms of offering customers value it  undeniably does so. I dont use their software services much as I already had spotify/ youtube but have still got value from prime delivery through their food and items as well as occasional prime video and audible. There's more they can be doing environmentally to offset such a large footprint but due to how logistically efficient they are it brings down the CO2 emissions per parcel compared to driving to collect the same item yourself! They can also invest in electric or alterenative fuel methods for their vehicles.Paper and cardboard packaging on all orders is recyclable/reusable and I've been able to support small online/sustainable businesses through the marketplace The shopping experience is excellent and the delivery very professional.The value offered is great, and with such a large selection of products and reviews its not difficult to find what you're after. The tracking and history of orders is exceptional, as well as the ability to create multiple lists (wish lists) that could be shared.Used items can also be found on the platform too, which is a better choice for the environment than brand new, I've recently found a growing offering of recycled plastic items which is even better as it creates a demand to get the products out of our environment.I barely touched on the software/ streaming applications and services offered which is a large part of the subscription and could be worth the monthly fee in it's own right.I'd be quite surprised if you had anything but a positive experience. I can't comment from an empoyee/ seller side of the company but as a customer I keep coming back and will continue to aslong as I receive great service. As buyers we need to continue to carefully consider the demand our purchases place on the environment but it's good to know that Amazon can align with this goal shoud we choose to.I look forward to seeing more sustainably powered vans adopted and encouragement for smaller local and quality goods sellers promoted on the home page.",2024,3,March,2024,6,5,1,GB

I was attempting to access my account to make a purchase, and upon reaching the login page and entering my credentials, the following message appeared: ‘Your account has been terminated for improper use of Amazon services. We have sent you an email with more information.’ (It was written in Italian, I translated it with Google translate). However, no email arrived in my inbox despite repeated attempts. I began searching online to see if anyone else had encountered the same issue. I found an email address where I could file a complaint. They responded stating: ‘as already communicated to you, we have closed this account. From our records, we have previously terminated your account for violating the terms of our user agreement. Following termination of your account due to breach of contract, you are not permitted to open a new account or use another account to place orders on our site. Following a thorough evaluation, we have decided not to restore your full access to this account. It will therefore not be possible for you to place orders on our site. Any digital content purchased with this account is still available to you. To access the content, click the Manage content and devices link in the My Orders menu on Amazon.it.’ Despite my attempts to seek clarification, they provided the same generic responses, failing to explain the exact reason for the account termination and how I violated the terms of the agreement. Furthermore, they mentioned that I could still access digital content purchased with the account, which was untrue since my account was closed, leaving me without access to anything.Adding insult to injury, I own a Kindle that was linked to my account.

Here arises an interesting question: how did they learn that my account was closed if my device was not connected to Wi-Fi? This implies that Amazon has another means of controlling my data and my device. All the books I downloaded, all the notes I made in the books, all the progress I made (I usually read several books at the same time) - everything was gone! An empty Kindle!!!I am deeply disappointed and angry with the situation and feel utterly helpless in resolving this problem.

US,"As a seller on Amazon's platform, I must express my utter disappointment and frustration with their blatant disregard for the well-being of their sellers. It's evident that Amazon prioritizes profit over the integrity of its marketplace, as they consistently side with consumers even in cases of obvious fraud, leaving sellers to bear the brunt of the consequences.One of the most egregious issues plaguing Amazon's marketplace is their lenient approach towards fraudulent claims made by customers. Despite ample evidence proving that customers have received the items they ordered, Amazon readily refunds them at the expense of the sellers. This not only results in financial losses for sellers but also creates an environment ripe for exploitation.The fact that Amazon retains the fees they charge sellers, even in cases of fraudulent refunds, highlights their complete lack of accountability. Sellers invest their time, resources, and efforts into the platform, only to be met with indifference and exploitation by Amazon.Unlike on my own website, where stringent policies deter fraudulent activities, Amazon's lax approach enables customers to exploit the system with impunity. The frequency of such occurrences is alarming and severely undermines the profitability of selling on Amazon.It's evident that Amazon's policies are designed to prioritize market share over the well-being of sellers. Their relentless pursuit of dominance in the e-commerce industry has led them to sacrifice the livelihoods of countless sellers in the process. It's high time that sellers unite and hold Amazon accountable for their unethical practices.In conclusion, Amazon's facilitation of fraud and exploitation of sellers is unacceptable. Their policies not only undermine the integrity of the marketplace but also pose a significant threat to the livelihoods of sellers. It's imperative that sellers take a stand against such injustice and demand accountability from Amazon.",2024,3,March,2024,7,1,0,US

It will randomly send shipments to other addresses in your address book, even if the last 5 went to your default. I called customer service and they said it's because I ordered it BUY NOW. But, it says in their fine print that Buy Now orders go to default payment + address. Customer service used to be amazing, but now is abysmal. I think it's time to cut the cord.

GB,"Amazon encourages the customer to use pick-up points. And so I did. In September 2023 I purchased a book to pick up at a pick-up point. The book is set to be delivered in April 2024. That is 7 months later. In January I ordered 2 books, both are set to be delivered at a pick up point in August. Again, 7 months later. This morning I ordered 2 books. First I selected the pick up point. It said that they would be delivered in December. I reconsidered and selected my home address. Now it says that they will be delivered next week. WHAT SCAM ARE THEY RUNNING? I contacted customer support. After some waffling (what a waste of time), they said they couldn't do anything about it.

US,"Tired of waiting for ARC (Amazon Claims Department) to process my claim, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  Within 12 HOURS I got two phone calls and an email from the lawyer representing ARC, expressing his wish to settle.  The next day, I got another email or phone call from the same lawyer. In the email he stated he agreed to what I had claimed.  And I gave the lawyer permission to cut the check by email. I am sharing this because I am so surprised at how expediently they want to avoid a lawsuit.  It must not look good to have high numbers of lawsuits filed against Amazon to report in their Annual Report to their shareholders.  ""Claim # AMZ.  Christina is the person handling the case.On a rainy day, an Amazon driver attempted to back out of my driveway, skidding down and running over my mailbox.  The van got stuck on the mailbox post, and a tow truck was called to pull out the van.  The damage to the lawn and the mailbox is well documented in video and photos, which ARC received.  Most recently, ARC stated that since I had filed for lawn damage 3 years ago, this is a repeat claim.   And demands that I submit a photo of the lawn repair from three years ago because the present lawn damage may be a replicated claim.  And I quote Christina from ARC representing Amazon.com.   ""As for the previous damages and showing the repairs, this is a new policy that has been put in place. Unfortunately this alerts us to people who have filed multiple times for damages.""  My argument is when new damages are inflicted by Amazon drivers,  Amazon should pay for damages no matter when it occurs.  When I sent her the email from three years ago, which never mentioned a photo she was using to reject the claim, she stated that she would look into it.  It is impossible to produce a photo from three years ago that was not taken or requested.  It is such a nonsense to reject a claim.  And Christina will ignore me until I bug her again; this has been going on for over THREE months!    It is utterly surprising that Amazon has resorted to this kind of CUSTOMER UNFRIENDLY practice.  Amazon.com is NOT a customer-friendly company!  I will file a claim with the small claims court.  I am so disappointed at how awful Amazon has turned out.  Seeing the same type of claim as mine here shows that this is not just one ARC representative who has gone rogue. It is Amazon's policy. ",2024,3,March,2024,3,1,0,US

Not a huge amount and doesn’t warrant spending hours to explain at Amazon but when I tried a few times, it was an absolute nightmare. Waiting for customer adviser’s supervisor to get back . Finally they agree to refund . Then you don’t get the refund ! Who has hours to chase this? That’s how they make so much money wrongfully obtained . Imagine doing this to their millions of customers how much they are making. Second I keep receiving empty parcels from Amazon. Initially , I couldn’t understand why but when I read online , many people were receiving empty packages . That is to boost fake reviews.

I started trying to cancel the order on 3/2 yet was told I couldn’t since the carrier had it, they didn’t.Basically they just lost roughly 10 years of annually paid Prime, roughly 5 years of prime video, kindle unlimited, Amazon Music and 5 Alexa products all over a $22 item that I no longer need because it didn’t arrive on time.

As potential future customers we wanted to know whether Amazon would be safe and reliable by asking what had caused the delivery failure and to receive an email or phone call describing how the problem had been resolved.

None of these are acceptable. The first customer service advisor told us the vehicle was moving and that the package would probably be delivered late.

Poor delivery service again.  Not good enough Amazon.Update.  Parcel was handed to a person yesterday and has now been received in the right place.

US,"I have been an Amazon customer for 15 years but unfortunately I will not be renewing my Prime membership or ordering from Amazon anymore. I had ordered a computer and was sent the wrong computer. I sent it back and did get my refund right  away. I ordered another computer from a different seller and was sent the wrong computer once again. I received an approval from the seller immediatly to return it, so I returned it immediately. This particular seller decided to not issue a refund. I reached out to him and he was telling me how he is ""investigating"" it, even though he sent the wrong computer.  However, he used the ""investigation"" as an excuse to hold my money hostage for weeks. I really needed my money back as computers cost alot of money and I needed to buy another one since I had dropped and broken mine. I reached out to Amazon customer service and the customer service rep profusely apologized and said they would submit the prime A-Z guarantee ticket and also give me a $10 gift certificate credit to my Amazon account for my troubles. I was pleased about this and was immediately sent a survey in which I gave raving reviews of the customer service I had just received. However, as time passed,  I hadn't heard a word nor did I receive any confirmation email and also didn't see any $10 gift card credit. I had to take time out to reach customer service again and the new agent said, I'm so sorry the agent before me never submitted the ticket for refund request and did not give you the $10 credit. I couldn't believe it and wondered what kind of customer service is this? So this new rep and me went back and forward with a bunch of bs they were telling me that this computer  isn't covered with A-Z guarantee and there is nothing they can do. I reminded the agent it WAS listed as Prime and they are incorrect and then I started asking what is wrong with Amazon sellers and customer service at Amazon? I told this agent I have witnessed some of the sellers and customer service going downhill fast. I asked them if Amazon is supporting their sellers stealing from their customers  even when they order a Prime listed product. All of a sudden it was a miracle as the rep decided to issue my return. I asked him, how about issuing me the $10 credit also. This rep said, oh yes, of course, but it will take at least a couple hours to register in your account. At this point, it was no surprise that I never have received the $10 gift card credit nor any notice about it even being initiated. Needless to say, I am bewildered. I decided to get a Costco membership the next day and have already found replacements for many things I've ordered over the years with Amazon and set up to have my account not renew my Prime membership in April. Something is seriously wrong at Amazon now and they lost me as a customer.  I have ordered thousands of dollars each year for many years. Here is a statement from Jeff Bezos I found on the Internet. “We have always wanted to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company.  We won’t change that. It’s what got us here.  But I am committing us to an addition.  We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work.”  My question to Jeff is....what kind of ""addition""  have you established in the workplace that allows shady sellers and awful customer service? I looked online and found a bunch of complaints about the seller who people are saying is an outright thief. It took me two minutes to run the company name and find this information. It took me to long to figure out how to see the actual Amazon seller reviews on which seems like it is hidden it's so hard to find now. I wrote a review stating what happened,  but to date I can't see it on his Amazon seller account and he's still on Amazon selling his computers! This is not acceptable.

I advised that this had a years Amazon Guarantee and it wasn't that i didn't like it it was because it was completely broken.

I ordered 3 tubes of arnicare cream to help the bruising.  I watched on the app last night as the delivery drew nearer. It was dark but I could see it was parked up. Within minutes it had disappeared and a message put up that it had been put through the letterbox.The complex where I live does not have letterboxes. It has a secure entrance and delivery people press the appropriate flat number and access is given by the occupier. This person didn't even bother to walk to the residence.  I was waiting at the door to receive the parcel with 3 other people with me waiting to see where the Amazon guy was. Whoever he is he LIED. At first Amazon said it would be delivered by 9am today and then they said if it hadnt arrived by tomorrow to get back in touch.

I ordered something on prime which said next day delivery and it wasn't even shipped next day and took 5 days to receive.Jeff Bezos and Amazon are unethical and have no loyalty except to money & greed. Amazon platform was designed as a, ""online retail outlet"" for businesses and people to sell on.It wasn't enough to put many mom & pop stores out of business, their greed took over and they turned their backs on the very same people that built their business, the sellers.Once Amazon analyzed sales reports and repeat sales they decided to screw the seller and began to sell their own branded products like batteries etc.They used the US Postal Service, FEDEX and UPS until they decided to operate delivery services.They place their ""ads"" prominently when you search for a product, giving them a greedy, unfair advantage.If that wasn't enough their Prime Services have gotten more expensive and they pushed back their delivery guarantees.Prime has increased, Amazon Music has increased, Audible has increased and NOW, after paying for an inferior ""Prime"" product that continues to decline, they decided to put ads on Prime Video and if you want ""ad free"" it is an additional $2.99 per month.Amazon Prime is inferior to Netflix as I have no issues streaming on Netflix or other Apps on tv, but Amazon constantly has lag issues and connection issues and doesn't respond.I have already been trimming my Amazon reliance, left Amazon Music, left Audible, using Amazon much less and can't wait to pull the plug on Amazon completely.I heard FEDEX is now going to compete with Amazon and in Fall of 2024 they are supposed to be launching their own online selling platform!!

So that would mean if I wanted the color I actually ordered they would get half the money from me returning the wrong one they sent me and them a whole orders worth of money from the second order and act like I'm stupid and don't know what they are up to. Also the whole ""verify by a third party"" to see if you qualify for amazon prime access program. That option doesn't exist and even if I was interested I would not give a scammy billion dollar company that has no respect for their customers or employees my sensitive documents. They want to play stupid games, the best thing is to let them have the dummy prize of not having our business or so much less business that it hurt them. I called them out on this in my review of the item and they refuse to post it, so they know what they are doing. We have been hurting since covid and the inflation. The only way not to lose more money is to not shop at places where they are actively trying to find new and creative (lying by omission is an old tried and true, not creative) ways of trying trying to rob people of their money in this heavily inflated ""economy."" Shop where you know your getting a good/great deal and not constantly having to fight not to be parted with money that you know is yours.

A few days later the courier delivered to the wrong address well, according to the photo of the 'proof of delivery' we were able to prove that it was not our address and house and of course it was refund done. A few weeks later we tried to order again exactly the same and guess what, the same again! This time he got a ""suspicious activity warning"" warning on my son's account and I tried to speak to customer service to confirm it wasn't his fault! A few months later he ordered 'headphones' which cost around £100 so guess what, same thing happened again!!! We were at home and no delivery only an email that you received the parcel...?! I called again and told the situation that we did not receive the shipment, I have security camera footage and can send proof that the courier was not at my place at the time. He said wait a few days and maybe the courier will deliver because sometimes the system mistakenly says delivered but they are still on their way. So we waited and called again after a few days. They advised to check the neighbors and come back in 48 hours. After a few days we called again... they said that will investigate and report back. After that call... a few days later my son's account was suspended due to an investigation. Tried to contact again and called like 10 more times trying to figure out what's going on here....asked for a photo of ""Proof of Delivery""....but (still haven't received it yet) ...so they shut down completely account and did not refund because their courier said the package was delivered safely to the location. today I spoke to an amazon ""manager"" who did not help me at all...couldn't give a ''Proof Of Delivery''...and no one can help because the courier said the item was delivered to the address and she can't change anything. The advice was from her... to contact the police...... So my son was left without money and without headphones. Therefore, dear future customers of Amazon....be careful...because if the courier steals from you...amazon will do nothing and you will be left without money and goods...and nothing to prove that it is not your fault.

US,"Amazon Business Key installer came out our multifamily condo complex at 11:21pm and decided they would disassemble the two postal style locks on our gate control box and cut the added chain to gain access to our control panel and install their hardware. This is ridiculous at best. Who the f$#k do they think they are? We are considering pressing charges as it is all on recorded camera footage. First to come out at 11:20pm is a bit shady, and then to damage our locks and cut out chain and twist and bend the (brand new!!) gate control box cover is just uncalled for. Amazon Business Key is nothing to begin with. For our property,  the driver still has to enter a code on his/her phone (or something similar) to send to the gate controller to open the gate. It takes no longer amount of time for the driver to reach out the window and enter a four digit code to open gate. Amazon has gone too far this time. Showing up at 11:20 in the dark of night to cut our chains and damage our locks is not acceptable.",2024,2,February,2024,3,1,0,US

US,"Avoid Purchasing from Third Party Sellers on AmazonI recently purchased an item through Amazon that was sold by a third party seller. During shipping, the carrier marked the package as ""incorrect address"" without attempting delivery and said it would be returned to sender.After weeks of trying to get this resolved, neither the carrier nor third party seller could deliver the item or provide a refund. When I complained to Amazon, their customer service repeatedly passed the buck back to the third party seller rather than helping as the merchant of record.I offered extensive documentation, screenshots, and spent hours on calls trying to reach a solution. Amazon refused to step in and resolve the situation themselves, even after it was clear the package was lost. They would only say they ""notified the seller on my behalf"" but took no responsibility.It is unacceptable that Amazon sold this item but then refused to remedy their inability to fulfill the purchase as promised. After threatening chargebacks and complaints, Amazon still denied a refund and closed the case. They clearly have no intention of standing behind third party transactions that go wrong.I will never purchase something sold by third parties on Amazon again after this nightmare experience. Amazon has proven they are unwilling to protect customers when issues arise beyond our control. It is a waste of time to work with their customer service, who will only pass you off endlessly without resolving the problems their marketplace creates.

That makes Amazon complicit in the continuing STD problems in the gay community.  They can't have it both ways. Amazon needs to filter and censure the authors whose books contain these scenes, which is probably all the books in this category, OR allow important, constructive reviews like mine.

Time to involve trading standards lots of screen shots of the adverts taken and I think I will also contact the BBC rip of Britain 🇬🇧 they like stuff like this Amazon never will I buy from you again  as you are deceitful and fundamentally dishonest,2024,2,February,2024,34,1,0,GB

At about noon on 2/6/24 I went to track shipment and saw that the delivery date was now changed to 2/27/24 by 9 p.m -- even though it was picked up from a carrier facility 7 miles from the delivery address. I was back and forth with customer service chat who didn't want to tell me why it would be an extra day to deliver an item 7 miles away. They deflected and gave me UPS's number. UPS told me that it told Amazon last night that it wouldn't be able to deliver it today.Meanwhile, Amazon stopped the chat while I was holding with UPS and I had to start again. For a $250 item they wanted to offer me a $10 gift card. Then they offered instead a month off my prime membership -- and cut off the chat again. I called customer service but apparently they said they were the promotion department. They said as a gift and an apology they'd offer me a $100 voucher but I would have to pay for the shipping and handling. I pointed out that it's not a gift if I have to pay shipping and handling. The rep said he wasn't charging for the voucher just the shipping and handling. I told him that's not the way to treat a loyal prime customer. He kept saying ""OK you're not interested"" and I said that wasn't true I just didn't feel I should have to pay shipping and handling. He hung up on me.I called again and got through to customer service and he said he couldn't give any compensation, then said he could give $5. I told him that I had saved the previous chats and I was offered a month of free membership (about $12). He said Amazon can't do that which I know isn't true. I asked for an email address to send the chat and he wouldn't give me an email address. He then hung up.This is Amazon's idea of customer service.

Not only the drivers will drop the parcel at the door without even considering ringing the door-bell (if the parcel is to large to go through the letter-box) regardless to the weather condition. They use to be careful about delivering the parcels but no anymore!! It could be a result of work pressure and delivery quota per driver. Our house is located on the corner of two roads with a front garden leading to the front door via our drive. Last Friday 02nd Feb we were expecting a delivery of a new air-fryer as notified by AMAZON. We were sitting watching TV at lounge which by the front door at around four o'clock in the afternoon when I received an e-mail  from AMAZON stating the the package was delivered and left by the front door (with a photo showing that), so immediately we open the door but found nothing!!!! We looked everywhere around the house in case the driver decided to hide the package but there was nothing!! It is unusal for our neighbours to pick anything from the front of our door unless we were on a holiday and have requested them to do so! Our neighbourhood where we live, is very safe and never encountered nor heard of any theft! Furthermore, It needed someone there and ready for the delivery to be dropped so that he/she swiftly grab  it and run with it which is remotely to happen. Unless, the driver took the photo and picked it up again and took it. No one would've  suspected that action as it would look as if he was returning the item back to the van!! Even if we caught him doing it, he could easily say I didn't want to leave it at the door!!  Both our cars where there on the drive and our door-bell is working!!!!!!! So, we called AMAZON who initially integrated us asking if we are sure is not there, or with neighbours ..etc before telling us that we need to wait 72 hours before we can report it undelivered. So, we waited until Monday 05th and we requested a call-back where we discussed the issue!! Regrettably, the customer-service agent who was based in Ireland could not get through to the correct department who could resolve the issue and told us that she will leave a message on the system for them to call us back and assured us that the case will be resolved. No call was received so today (Tue 06th) once again requested a call back and we spoken to another agent based in Ireland who passed us to another colleague (sounded as if based in India) and who also passed us to another of his colleagues there who told us that they 72 hours  to investigate the matter and we have to wait!!

What is the reason to hold my money for so long? If their employees could consider my case with common sense, they could do more than just generic, useless instruction, as a machine.

I could have watched the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy twice over while waiting for a response. It's almost as if they take pleasure in making you wait endlessly, dangling the hope of resolution like a carrot on a stick.To top it all off, when a resolution was finally offered, it was so inadequate that I might as well have been talking to a brick wall. It's clear that Amazon's customer service is more concerned with closing tickets than actually solving problems.Save yourself the headache and frustration.

US,"Here's the thing about mega huge companies that service consumers: They don't need to care about you. If a company has many millions of customers, and 90% of those customers escape doing business with amazon without issues, then the company has little to worry about.If amazon is making enough to send rockets into space, build their own warehouses, and buy their own delivery vehicles, they just don't need to care.I've been using amazon for decades and I suspect my recent issues have to do with policies enacted specifically to increase revenues.A few years ago I got locked out of my amazon account and customer service was no help. I pleaded with them to allow me SOME way to prove my identity beyond their asinine ""tell us the last 3 things you ordered."" At that point, I hadn't used my account in 3 months so I just did not remember the last 3 things I ordered, AND, amazon had at that point stopped showing orders on order confirmation emails. Instead, confirmation emails were only giving a link back to your amazon order page. Useless if you're locked out of your account. I did ultimately realize a way to get back into the account on my own.Most recently, while traveling, I ordered some items from different sellers, but items fulfilled by amazon to be delivered to an amazon locker. I waited, and then checked the amazon order page which showed that ALL the items were cancelled. I called amazon customer service but they knew absolutely nothing, so I reordered those items and waited again. A week later, I checked the amazon order page and yet again, all items were cancelled. This time, I insisted on talking to someone above the first person I spoke to. Then, they ended up handing me off to an actual American who worked specifically with the lockers, but that person just listened to my complaint and then said they'd tell someone else, blah, blah, blah. For some reason the UPS driver was cancelling my orders and nobody would tell me why. When I went to make the order a third time, I saw on the order page, for the first time, in red text, that the locker I had chosen was full. Mystery solved, no thanks to amazon, because they obviously have a low cost deal with UPS to deliver packages to their amazon lockers and the deal does not include bringing undeliverable items to a UPS facility so a customer can pick stuff up there. Instead, the driver just cancels the order and everything gets returned to amazon fulfillment centers with zero notification to the customer. My other major issue with amazon is that they did away with commenting on reviews for products. This was a super valuable method of sharing information with other consumers who took the time to write reviews. I suspect they stopped allowing this because people occasionally were recommending different products and that was obviously not good for them. Amazon has gotten progressively more and more antagonistic towards consumers but they know they can because there just is no alternative for us.",2024,2,February,2024,12,1,0,US

US,"Amazon received two $100 Visa debit gift cards from me - these were referral rewards from my health sharing program. The first I loaded per online instructions as a debit card, and it looked fine, for a day. I then loaded the second Visa debit gift card, but it loaded as $89.12 instead of $100. Got on chat and went through 3 people until one of them said something like ""Okay, I'm adding $11, plus a $10 courtesy for your trouble."" It was apparently a glitch in the system. The Visa debit was showing as $100.12 on the order. I then ordered a vacuum cleaner, putting the balance on my CC. TODAY my account now says ""We couldn't charge your selected payment method, so we charged your backup payment method."" They charged my CC $100. This is not cool. I am doubly paying the $100 for the vacuum. Back to the first Visa debit card, which I loaded and had appeared as a gift card with $100 in the system. I received an email on 01/31/2024 that said I had successfully loaded it, and they gave an $8 bonus for the load. Great! Problem is, it was zeroed out quickly, and when I went through the chat, one guy told me the amount would be reloaded within 24-48 hours. I then got an email saying that the payment failed. Of course it failed! They already got it from the card balance!Back to chat the morning of 02/02. They sent me to a phone person immediately, a lady named T. She was SO rude, as we had a lag, and she insisted on schooling me about how there was now no lag and so forth. T. was completely condescending. Needs education about tech and how to treat customers with respect. She  finally told me that the first thing people usually do is call the issuing bank. I am not in the habit of using Visa debit gift cards, and did not know that. She treated me like a child. I called the bank and they were completely helpful, giving me two transaction numbers when Amazon transferred funds into their system. But this is for Visa Debit GC #1. Who knows if it will work? I still have to try to claw $ back from them for the vacuum cleaner purchase with Visa debit #2. This has already cost me 2 hours of work. SO frustrated.The upshot - DON'T trust Amazon to deal with these debit gift cards. Their system will steal your money. Their Customer Service is quite ineffective and apparently doesn't work for this issue. They should be set up to not receive them at all, since it's so screwed up.I will edit this post after my next contact with Amazon Customer Service.",2024,2,January,2024,9,1,0,US

IE,"I was offered a FREE 7 day, NO OBLIGATION trial of Amazon PRIME as I landed at the check out webpage. I opted in: ""sure why not says I""However after a day or so, I had buyer's remorse and choose to cancel my Amazon Prime membership. What happened next was disappointing:My item went missing for 10 days without a notification from the seller - who had shipped it - or Amazon PRIME - who had lost it! Reaching out to Amazon online, I asked what had happened to my purchase. Having been compelled to call Amazon, after a long wait, I opted for a call back. A very nice lady offered me a full refund. FYI, this option was not displayed to me online. ""Great ! thanks, yes please. Let's do that"". Guess what happened next? She sends the money back into my credit card account  and withing a couple of hours of it happily resting in my account - don't I get an email next day saying the product was being delivered!  It arrives; I print the RETURNS LABELS and stick them to the unopened box. Then I noticed that the Package required a STAMP, which turned out to be €9.00 So I found myself being put in a position of PAYING for accepting a NO OBLIGATION FREE TRAIL OF AMAZON PRIME 24-48 HOUR SHIPPING - should I RETURN a refunded order. Mmmm!?!OR alternately I am tacitly being invited to injure my personal integrity if I don't post the (now) unwanted item back to the shop who in fact had sold and shipped it in good faith. It seems to me that it ought to be the manager responsible for the online Free AMAZON PRIME trail promotion- who should be the individual sanctioned for making an offer s/he never intended to honor in word as well as spirit.

Several orders had arrived late and this has been all the way back to summer of this year. I don’t care about the music I use YouTube, I don’t watch a lot of shows so the free shows on prime are not why i have it. I got it for fast delivery. The thing is that now apparently they are raising there prices of prime. I don’t order enough for that even to be worth it as I have found other means of getting stuff through Instacart which arrives extremely fast. And Amazon doesn’t have the cheap deals anymore. Everything has gone up in price and if I can order Kirkland brand olive oil from Costco cheaper through Instacart I’m going to do that. As for clothes the prices are through the roof and with Temu it’s literally free delivery and half the price and same quality material. Guess what I ordered a dress from Amazon they took 3 months to get. I order 1 from Temu and it’s cheaper and took 14 days actually 12 it was early.  Also you can’t use Amazon gift cards anymore to purchase digital stuff. That’s my main source for games and sometimes the game has a booster pack that is a digital code. Some games also come only in digital. If they were fast at delivery like they used to be I of course would be fine with a physical game. But no I literally never got my game and had to cancel it.

Who does that? except someone who NOT supposed to be hired. I have a french account with them that I AM GOING TO CLOSE + all my family members.

EE,"Amazon CS is lately a complete mess. So much so, that I've actually stopped using Amazon. When you have an issue, an agent (on the chat) tells you that they'll take ownership, but it's always a lie. Each and every time you send another email, following-up on the case, you get a template-based answer from a different agent, mostly filled with empty words, and little substance. On several occasions, they've sent me contradicting or incorrect information about delivery dates or deadlines for certain actions. When they give you false information, they don't take any responsibility for it, nor do they ever provide the official complaint form, as they should do as per EU legislation. My time is worth more than the discounts or variety of products they may offer. It's just not worth it.",2024,1,January,2024,5,1,0,Other
US,"Amazon offered what they call a, ""Lightning Discount"", to an item in my cart. The discount was for $81.When I went to check-out, the discount was taken away. I spoke with a supervisor at costumer service, who told me that those discounts last for 15 minutes. To me, that's ridiculous. Especially for a 5 year Prime member, who's spent thousands with Amazon. I learned this after a 2 hour long run-around with customer service. The supervisor refused to re-honor their discount. I'm paying $100 more than Amazon's regular price with one of their competitors.

US,"Just sheer incompetence being displayed on the part of this organization and never wanting to take full responsibility for their actions, especially when it comes to making mistakes and then they have the gaul and nerve to accuse me of lying to them?! Here's what happened here and hoping these fools get exposed for what they are doing there and Bezos gets his head out of his butt and takes a further and strong look as to how his operation is being run there and whom he's hiring as customer service staff there, aka cheap labor from third world countries who can barely speak English or be able to formulate a sentence properly...here is what happened to me recently...I would like to voice a complaint against the biggest online retailer in the world, that being Amazon.com. So in a nutshell this past week, I ordered a Coke Zero mini fridge they were selling and there are two different designs to them, one has a bottle on it and the other has a full logo splurged horizontally across the door, and thinking I was finally going to receive the bottled version after two other attempts at getting this resulted in returning them both back for full refunds, a few leadership team members had promised and assured me I would finally be receiving the item that is pictured and when I received the item late last night at home (1/20/2024), I received yet the same item I received the other two times over and now having to return that as well. I have been in constant battles with their inept & incompetent customer service division & I have requested to speak to higher ups there to rectify this problem, but they have done nothing but lead me astray like a puppy dog, ignoring my requests and then accusing me of lying to them that I actually received the correct item when I did not & I showed them the two links in question, side to side and pinpointed this in as many ways as possible, but still, they refuse to do anything to help me out and I have just about had it with them. I truly feel they are practicing fraudulent and deceptive advertising at that website and I am at my wits end with them to boot! I do not appreciate being accused of something I didn't even do here and I could care less whether promotional credit was used or not on this item to cover said costs of the product, it was still the wrong item shipped out to me and nothing has been done to rectify this mess. I submitted further proof & evidence as they had requested to show them I was not making any of this stuff up and I never heard back from them, so I re-contacted them to no avail, so hoping this situation gets remedied this once & for all! They're oblivious to never wanting to admit they were at fault for anything but rather, blame the customers and now they're asking for solid proof too?! Well, they got it as this kind of chicanery needs to cease right here and now!All this over a mini fridge they're selling that has two different logos to it and when you order it from them, what is displayed versus what one actually does receive are literally quite different in so many ways and aspects, as it's beyond comprehension with them. Just a sad excuse for an organization to be doing any of this to their loyal and faithful customers.UPDATE on 1/23/2024 at 2 PM CT...Well, I have to give them credit where credit is due as it took a major interaction with their corporate team and CEO to get to the bottom of this craziness and I am happy to report that they came through with fixing this messed up and screwed up order and they even offered humblest apologies for accusing me of lying about everything associated with that order and what I received and such. I still would be very cautious about doing business with them, no matter how well known they are as their customer service division really needs a huge and major overall and to bring in people who can actually speak the English language properly and truly give a damn about helping their customers who keep that business afloat on a daily basis. Serious re-training of their staff needs to be done at once as they all seem in quite a bit of a hurry to conclude chat and phone conversations without properly delving into the key issues one might have with their orders. I'll change my rating to a 4 star review from one as they acted appropriately but again, thank goodness for getting in touch with their corporate division and CEO or I'd still be having issues with getting this nonsense solved to this very day, but it's now done and completed and let's hope they don't screw up any more of my orders from here on out. I can hope, right?!",2024,1,January,2024,11,4,1,US

It never recognized my fingerprint to unlock apps, and ran slower than my 3G android. I inquired a better refund explaining that I am mobile impaired. They insisted that I needed to bring it to the post office and send it that there was no way to have it picked up. Discontent but still agreeing I ordered a new phone upon its arrival I began to switch insensitive apps to the new phone and everything appeared to be fine I searched the internet so that I could probably factory reset the other phone to clear my data. I then began to reenter passwords and log into accounts and verify the IP address to the new device when I noticed that I didn't have administration rights on the new device because it hadn't completely wiped the old device and fragments of the applications remained. Which meant I needed to reboot the First new phone that I got so the IP address would register in the applications and I could make the transfer from within. After 4 hours of watching the screen turn and turn and tell me downloading and updating I powered off and put the phone away and try it again in a few hours. Extremely frustrated I called Amazon customer service back again today and made it very clear that they need to do something because I have to bring that phone now to a technician to have him go into the hard drive and extract my data.

Upon unwrapping the book an entire section in one piece of 65 PAGES fell out of the book onto my lap. Now both the seller and Amazon are refusing a partial refund (for book) cassettes are good.

US,I’m tired of waiting forever for items because Amazon ships through the USPS system. When looking at tracking I’ve watch my items come and go right through my city and not be delivered. It would be one thing if I picked the carrier to deliver my items but when it’s free delivery you don’t get a choice. I think it’s time to go directly to the seller and skip Amazon all together.,2024,1,January,2024,43,1,0,US

US,"Again updating a request to Bezos and Amazon prime.Why isn't there a discount for people receiving SSDI or SSI seniors?We are NOT on Snap or do not get food stamps.But we are barely getting by.What that isn't poor enough for you.  We could qualify for benefits but will not until needed.  Not everyone can afford mansions.Most of us are living month to month.We have gotten 2 COLA raises that were way over due.  And what happens?  Everyone jacks up prices yet again.  Our trash company went from $84 to $136 every 3 months.  We in my town can not pick a different company since the City decided one company for us.  So the have free  will on what we pay.  The cost of living is $2300 a person I get $800 plus on SSDI.  My husband $1200 plus $2000 for retirement.  Our house payment went from $850 to almost $2000 a month. He spends out of pocket $400 on PT 8 times a month. Insurance doesn't cover Holistic treatments.Our CCs are still maxed since attorney in his car accident didn't apply all medical cost to settlement.OOPS too late now.  And took almost half of his settlement for payments. But yet he has life long medical issues.  Couldn't sue a 22 yr old that has nothing or his friend who owned the truck that hit my husband,  Had what is required for insurance in my state.  Which is basic coverage.  We can't downsize since rent is more than we're paying for house payment.We can't borrow against house since we did that to take care of MIL for 15 yrs. So we are looking to move out of state.  We have no equity anymore in house.  And will be lucky to get $50,000.But we can't get a discount on Amazon for seniors or disabled????  Come on Bezo's your yacht is bigger than our house and lot.  And your online CS is all people outside the USA so they have NO clue about disability.We also have to pay for extra insurance because government insurance is rotten.  We pay almost $400 between us for government required insurance and almost $1500 more out of pocket.  We're both ill and disabled. My husband is diabetic and has traumatic brain injury and back and neck, leg foot and more injuries. I have life threatening allergies to  almost all antibiotics and foods and environmental , fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue asthma, knee, neck and back injuries from work injury. And also 3 brain injuries as a child.  I think we deserve a discount more than most getting free rides of the government.I get Amazon several times a month.

GB,Reading the reviews below. I have never had one bad experience with Amazon and have used them for years. Maybe people have been unlucky with the delivery drivers in certain areas but in my experience quite frankly what is there not to like with Amazon you get your orders on time. Returns are free and easy to do. Refunds are quick. On the other hand my experience of Chinese companies is the opposite. You try returning an item and getting a refund. Good luck with that one. 🤣  They are mainly based in Shanghai or USA. Number one so no free returns. They wear you out haggling because they just want you to accept their shoddy goods and go away so you lose your money. So you return your goods. Next they say they have not received them. So then they ask for proof of sending so you send that. Then they say they haven't received that. Finally sorted by Paypal but took 2 months of my valuable time. Thank god for Amazon!!,2024,1,January,2024,5,5,1,GB
GB,"Awful company. Ordered an iPad through Amazon prime which was due to arrive on the 22nd December in time for Christmas. On the day of delivery the parcels were out for delivery and then suddenly marked as being unable to deliver. After ordering thousands of pounds worth of stuff from Amazon in the past, they have never once had an issue finding the address. This started raising concern. The item then returned to the depot around 2330 that evening and was marked to be out for delivery the following day. The following day the supposed item was delivered and one time passcode given but instead of a package containing an iPad, it was a children’s book. The iPad had clearly been stolen and the label showed obvious signs of being swapped. Pictures were taken of the driver handing the parcel over along with evidence that the label was tampered with and the incorrect item was received. A complaint was officially logged with Amazon who said they’ll look into it. Pictures were sent to give the required evidence they asked for the same day (23rd December) but nothing was done about it still and they keep saying to “contact them again in a few days” every time we try to contact their customer services. I had to go out on the 23rd December to try and buy the gifted iPad elsewhere (from Currys, an actual store) and told Amazon this which is further proof we didn’t receive the iPad from them but they still delay and don’t offer any solution.",2024,1,December,2023,21,1,0,GB

As I have no reception I live in a house. I presumed the delivery must have been delivered somewhere wrongly. I once again contacted you because this kind of delivery is ongoing. Parcels are left anywhere despite clear instructions to use the delivery box right by the door,Deliveries have been left in bins, some on bin collection days. Some on the step some behind things in the garden. If you buy from Amazon you are tied into a game of hide and seek and if this is the case there should be a price reduction. If I want to play games I can play with my Grandson. Ex[pensive or electrical items have been left outside to the elements. I have reported it and reported it so many times and still this driver is doing the same things. All my deliveries are at risk of theft or damage.This morning I went to look if the parcel had been dumped. I found the receptionist a Scarecrow at the end of the garden, The driver had dumped the package right at the far end of the garden with my Grandsons Scarecow, It had been out there in the wet. That is something else he does leaves stuff in the rain. This person is delusional if he calls a scarecrow a receptionist. This is Amazon Prime too.

NL,"I ordered an IPhone 15 pro from Amazon Netherlands (sold by Amazon NL) several days ago but still haven’t received my phone despite paying the full price for the phone. I pay for Amazon “Prime membership” and expect the products to be delivered quicker. Unfortunately, I have still not received my phone after so many days and the Orders page shows status my order as “Undeliverable”. The phone is shown as “in stock” on the Amazon website so I am not sure why it can’t be sent to me. I don’t want a refund. I just want the phone to be sent to me since I paid for it, and it is said to be “in stock” at Amazon. I contacted Amazon helpdesk last week, but I still have no clear indication if I will get the phone. I am very disappointed and find Amazon a very unreliable site for ordering expensive products like iPhone. I recommend using a more reliable shop and save yourself a lot of trouble.

During this call, the representative, Jasper (07 Jan 2024, 22:31 Madrid time), attempted to verify my identity. Despite providing my order number, name, email, and even the billing address of my last delivery, they were unable to confirm my identity. This was perplexing, especially since the call was made to the phone number registered with my Amazon account.Furthermore, Jasper's attitude throughout the interaction was notably unprofessional. He demonstrated a lack of patience and courtesy, which only added to the frustration of the situation. I am disappointed with the level of service provided and hope that this feedback can lead to improvements in the future.

I won’t be taking in any more parcels for that property from now on and will hang onto the one I have in case they realise they haven’t received it and come and ask if I have it here.

GB,"It's hard to know where to start because there is now so much wrong with this company's services.Having been an Amazon Prime customer for well over a decade I have seen a lot of changes but recently the service has gone downhill to the point that I will not be renewing my subscription when it next expires.Particular issues that I've experiences are:1. Fake products - There are now a large number of cheap/dangerous knockoff products on amazon and it is impossible to tell from the listings which are genuine and which are the fakes.2. Reviews - The review system is broken and now so full of fake and even fraudulent reviews it has lost all meaning. Basic tricks like aggregating reviews for several products or even switching reviews over to a completely different product are common and no attempt seems to be made to stop this practice.3. Prime Delivery - This increased significantly in price and whereas once next day delivery was the norm, the minimum I am now quoted is 3 to 5 days with most items not even despatching for a couple of days after the order - as bad as the free delivery for non-prime members. It is not unusual for items to take two to three weeks to arrive despite paying the Prime premium.I am also seeing a lot of instances where the item goes to ""collected by courier"" status very quickly preventing order cancellation but no further movement or valid training information appears for several days suggesting that the item has probably not actually been despatched and that status change was just to stop me cancelling when I discover the delay.4. Prime Video - This was always a bit of a rip-off with most items incurring an extra charge on top of prime membership but the latest change forces you to pay an extra subscription on top of the already expensive Prime membership to get the add free viewing I got for free up until now.5. Prime music - this is another service that has been deliberately made almost unusable unless you want to pay yet another addition subscription on top.6. Customer services - All contact is via chat or phone, not email, so hard to make formal complaints or keep a paper trail. Although occasionally helpful, most of the time they merely read information to you that you can already see on the website and promises of action are rarely followed through.I have, at one point or another raised all of these issues with Amazon customer services only to be met with responses that ranged from complete indifference to promises to pass on my concerns which clearly went no further because nothing changed.In short, other than the convenience of having so many items in one place there is little to commend this company any more. Amazon Prime in particular is most definitely no longer worth the money.",2024,1,January,2024,2,1,0,GB

Unfortunately, the badly damaged tin of paint only arrived on 23rd December! I am never using this company again. I naively did not look at the company that was providing the paint and with a name like Lightning and Mobile Accessories UK, I am not surprised.

AU,"As a prime member, I have been using Amazon services in India and overseas for a long time. But the recent incident made me rethink regarding availing the services again. Recently, during my vacation in Noida India, I requested a refund for my order. Consequently, there was a pick up of the delivered product, but the pick man was very rude and acted like a local goon. He came 2 times for pickup. On the first visit, he misguided me and told me that the product he had come to pick up was of a different color by showing one of the different color product pictures. The second time, when I asked him why he misguided me, he became quite rude and started abusing me in front of my house and was not ready to leave the property despite repeated instructions by me to leave the property. I have CCTV footage regarding the incident. I hope Amazon will take steps accordingly as the only automated reply I got from their customer service and the head team is that 'you are our precious customer and they will take strong action against the pickup agent', but until now there has been no action and when I asked them about the status they told me that it is an internal matter which shows how serious they are regarding the incident and don't care about the customer.

US,"Amazon's customer service has totally let me down. After having an article stolen and another taken by animals I bought a box for the delivery driver to put the stuff in on the advise of Amazon's customer service personnel. She told me to contact customer service with delivery instructions and the driver would correctly put my stuff into the box.I've literally spent around 1 ½ hours trying to get the overseas customer service dept to set up delivery instructions. The first agent kept me on the phone 45 minutes without figuring out how to set up the instructions even though I tried many times to get her to connect me with supervision with the thought that they may know how to do this. Finally she sent me to her supervisor who assured me that the instructions were properly set up.The first delivery was wrong and I went through the same phone conversations again, only to have the second delivery not delivered in the box again.Trying to figure out how to get Amazon to get this done is seemingly impossible.Although I saw a story recently about Bezos calling his own customer service , he obviously was pleased with what he found judging by the result. This is the third delivery not placed into the container that customer service twice told me had been arranged.

GB,"When I signed up for prime, parcels got delivered on time and usually with a reliable delivery slot. Then, over time,  the delivery time occasionally changed to 'Today by 10PM'. Fair enough, sometimes things go wrong. But then this happened again and again to the point where it became standard practice. I don't work for Amazon and I didn't pay for Prime so that I could wait around for eight to ten hours a day until they could deign to provide the service I was paying them for. When I phoned up at 3pm on a friday (the same day as posting this review) to complain about it regarding an order which was marked as 'Out for delivery' since 9AM, instead of solving the problem, the agent on the phone said that ""actually, that's in a queue and might not be there until Sunday"". If that was the case, why was it showing as 'Out for delivery'? This combined with the reduction in selections to the point of being really quite pathetic on Amazon Fresh, and raising prices to cover the amount of money they have wasted on Prime Video just makes the company as a whole both complacent and arrogant to the point where they no longer deserve anybody's business. In fact, it got to the point where just dealing with Amazon literally just felt like being in an abusive relationship, which is why I cancelled my subscription.

GB,"I’ve written to Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy and his Executive Relations team on numerous occasions about Amazon’s breach of the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA) and theft of its customer’s intellectual property.  I stated in an e-mail to Mr Jassy, among other things, that I’m complaining about Amazon’s unlawful delivery policy.Amazon UK Services Limited (Amazon) continues to breach the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA) and is deliberately intruding on its customer's privacy and stealing their intellectual property by taking photos/images of their person and of their private property (location) without their express permission and Amazon is not transparent with how its processing, sharing and storing such data and is exacerbating its misconduct resorting to evasive tactics to avoid the issue, which is totally unacceptable.As far as I’m aware the conditions of purchase on all of my orders thus far, DID NOT include me having to give up my rights and allow Amazon to violate my privacy and take my intellectual property in exchange for delivering my parcels. If that were the case, I would certainly not have bought anything from Amazon. Amazon's fulfillment of contract is to simply deliver the parcels and ask for the recipient's name and signature which is legally sufficient for proof of delivery and which I would oblige if the drivers presented me with that option, but they don’t. They quickly snap a photo of you as soon as you open the door, drop the parcel off and walk away, even despite the large security notice on my front door clearly stating, ""THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY, NO PHOTOS OR VIDEOS ALLOWED!""It is clear that Amazon needs to urgently address its delivery policy and give customers an option to sign for their deliveries and it must train its drivers to understand and respect PRIVATE PROPERTY and the right of privacy.Below, are some of the evasive tactics that Mr Jassy and team have responded following my Complaint and Request for “Right of Erasure” (SARs)[OPEN Quote] This is Jassy with Amazon's Executive Relations team.By corresponding with me, you have reached the highest level of customer service within our company.

Some of the items were missing, and others arrived damaged beyond repair because the Amazon box had no packing around the individual items, and the weight of each item crushed other items and caused the tape to break on the Amazon box, allowing some of the items to fall out. I have contacted Amazon three times and spent over 3 hours on the phone, only to be hung up on. I have contacted them by chat 15 times with no help. One person finally said I would receive a refund but had lied. They told me to return the items through UPS, but UPS will not take the package because the items contain lithium and are dangerous to ship through the mail. I was then told to get a police report, but the police wouldn't write a report when the package was not stolen, and it was Amazon's fault for not packing the box properly. The items cost me $179.25, and I cannot get a refund, and Amazon refuses to help. They just reply with automated responses to return the items or get a police report. Still, I cannot do either because of the circumstances they caused by not packing the items properly for shipping. Buyer beware! Do not order expensive tech through Amazon because you cannot trust that they will be adequately packaged, and if they arrive damaged, Amazon will not issue a refund.

US,"You will be locked out of your Amazon account for supposed fraud by simply attempting to order any of their digital gift cards. Amazon is incapable of fulfilling these orders due to their failed “verification system” and helpless customer service agents. Even at the supervisor level there’s no human being who can override the system upon confirming with you on the phone that you’re in fact placing the order rather than a scammer. Amazon gives the appearance of great customer service by allowing you to speak with agents directly—agents who are trained to be pleasant and patient but given no access to fix any real issues. The software truly runs the company. I spent more than 3 hours speaking with 3 different departments trying to get back into my account and re-placing my order over and over. After two days of this, my order was canceled by their system repeatedly, my account is still frozen for any kind of digital order, and a family member also got locked out immediately for the same purchase. By comparison, we were able to purchase the gift cards (barely in time for Christmas) at a physical retailer quickly and with zero aggravation. Amazon lost $300+ of sales to a brick-and-mortar because their software is abysmal and their customer service impotent. Considering the constantly rising cost of the Prime subscription and the record profits Amazon reported during lockdowns this is all a cruel joke.

Managers, supervisor's, Representatives all that work there or at least 97 % aren't paddling with both ores in the water.  It's like someone shot the dots of their dice years ago. I'm a nice person however when you pay for Amazon prime and then sometimes pay extra to have same day delivery, what that really means is haha we got cha again. Cause ya don't receive your package.

When you do get the notification that your package has been delivered, best believe their saying haha got cha again. Cause it's been delivered to the wrong place. Then you call, excuse me my package says delivered but it's not at my house.

GB,Appalling customer service.I have purchased from Amazon many many times and never had an issue. This said however on 12 December I ordered a large item (a chair/bed) which is something I have not done before. I needed the chair/bed for a guest visit and ordered it on 10 December. I was initially happy with the fast delivery date which was due to be 14 December. However despite the fact that Amazon claim to have attempted delivery in 14 December this attempt definitely didn’t not happen (I have an advanced security system which I had reviewed) when the chair eventually arrived with no notice in 18 December on a dark wet and windy evening it was left by my gate in the rain until I could get help to lift the very heavy boxes inside. Once inside it took hours to put the chair together with the poor and hard to follow instructions. Once installed it was apparent that the chair was of very poor quality and defective. I immediately reported the matter to amazon who quite frankly have been totally unhelpful. They have basically explained the item is from a ‘third party seller’ which apparently means they don’t really care!! I have always believed that items bought on the Amazon platform gave me some kind of protection but this is definitely not the case. I am now still arguing with the ‘third party seller’ with no help from Amazon. I have been informed that the seller sees no problem with the chair which quite frankly is alarming in itself. I have been told I need to return the chair in the original packaging (which I don’t Have as it arrived wet and damaged) and pay for a courier to collect it !! I have since discovered that previous reviews of the same chair are much of the same .

It's all a facade.However, that's a totally different story when it comes to communication and treatment towards employees.Reviews on the site are sometimes fake with scammers acting as sellers while authentic opinions are being suppressed. I noticed the number of bots frequenting there as well. Also users/buyers can find their reviews being removed and discover themselves being banned from contributing for ""unusual reviewing activity"" by Amazon.  The moderators really have poor judgement behind their monitors. Another example is when employees that opperate in warehouses experience awful working conditions, the bosses there give the employees little time for a break. If you're an employee that have a problem, your boss is not going to show any mercy for your mental anguish.Pathetically enough, workers resorted in using pee-pee bottles if they need to urinate instead of going to the bathroom.Workers in that environment usually breakdown mentally and become severely exhausted. The most ludicrous resolve Amazon has to offer was coping spaces in 2021. These are mental health booths known as ""AmaZen.""In the Summer of 2023, Amazon decided to lock one of its customers, Brandon Jackson of Baltimore, Maryland, from his home connected with the smart home devices because a delivery driver allegedly heard a derogatory term through his doorbell.

One customer agent doesn’t know what the hell there doing and have no clue as to what to do in these circumstances, then you have to wait for a manager and neither do they know what the hell there doing either . I’m taking the matter further as this is defrauding me of my money that I was given as a Christmas present so nice one Amazon I might as well put all my money through the shredder , none of them want to take responsibility of the problems that arise I will not be purchasing from this company ever again and also I’ve , I’ve also cancelled my account and payments to Amazon there a disgrace so if you want to wast your money on there products more fool you . No responsibility or liability have they taken for there actions I’ve recorded every conversation that I’ve had with them as evidence and will be taking the matter further .

Previously, other delivery boys had just dropped my orders outside my door, on the pavement! Luckily, I noticed; otherwise, some passer-by could/would have picked it up for their own use. Amazon sucks! And their ""customer services""? ""Service""? Amazon needs to look up the word in the dictionary. Big Joke. They give you empty phrases, refuse to investigate, refer you to the police, they wash their hands, say they will not refund you, give you a deadline, until when you, the customer, have to comply with their orders.Whatever that bloke's name who owns amazon, he has fully joined the parasitic elites, as far as I can see.

US,"BUYER BEWARE. As a Prime Member, Amazon did NOT make good on an order even though they didn't follow delivery instructions asked for at the time of order. As a result, and as a possible theft, Amazon did NOT provide a refund or replacement order even after completing every required step stated by reps. Beyond the financial loss, be aware most reps are hard to understand, don't listen, don't bother to refer to file notes (if there are any). They seem to use the same scripts not related to a question or to the information just provided. Example: I tried to explain the local police referred us to the Sheriff’s Office to file a possible theft report as they have the law enforcement jurisdiction at our rural address. No question or acknowledgement but repeatedly stating, “You must file a police report.” Finally, when I asked to speak to a supervisor, the rep hung up!  Also, as in my case, you will never speak to the same rep again. Even after your claim reportedly goes to “escalation,” you must call the general customer service number and start over, which includes reexplaining EVERYTHING as if it’s the first time you called.  Maddening! Still, I did EVERYTHING required, even repeatedly.  I was finally reassured by one phone rep that he saw my PDF report on file, that all had been done including talking to the USPS. He said our claim would be resolved quickly after he sent all to Escalation and not to worry about the deadline since we had completed everything required by that date. Yet on the “deadline date,” I called and spoke to 2 reps. I was told by the first rep after placing me on an extended hold, that he had called the police department and they had no record of a report from me on file, therefore there was nothing Amazon could do.  I again explained I had sent a PDF of a Sheriff’s Department report due to law enforcement jurisdiction as instructed by the local police department three times! He just repeated the same thing again with no acknowledgement of what I just said.  I begged him to listen and not hang up. I asked what ""police"" number he had called to verify he had called the Sheriff's Department; he said he couldn’t share that information due to privacy. I verbally stated the phone number of the Sheriff’s Department and asked if he had called that number - he wouldn't answer. I then asked to speak to his supervisor and was assured the supervisor would give me the same information he had. After an extended hold, someone new got on the phone. With a rude demeanor, he repeated that they had no police report on file; therefore, there would be no further support – refund or reorder. When I insisted it was there, again explaining that the jurisdiction was with the Sheriff’s office, he stated it did not contain all the information required. With witness at my side, I asked repeatedly for him to provide specifics of what was not included as I had referred to their email requirements, emailed those requirements to the Sheriff's Department, and saw the report with my own eyes, confirming all requirements met. He would not answer my question and provided no details. Finally, he said it was an “initial report” and not a “final report.” I told him this was the first I heard this as required to which he insisted they had provided me this information. Their email information had said to call Amazon during the police's office hours so their rep could verify information and I did this. (As soon as my call ended, I called the Sheriff’s Department myself and got immediately through. The gentleman in the report/records department told me no one from Amazon had called. They also said the rep doesn’t understand law enforcement investigations because if they don’t have a suspect as in my case, it is considered an open case with no final report written or available.) Bottomline: I have wasted significant time and effort – for nothing. I’ve taken a big financial loss on goods not delivered and paid at the same time a Prime Member fee to experience this type of treatment. (I also unfortunately ended up in the ER due to the stress of this all with heart issues.) Almost humorous, as you are on hold, Amazon’s recording speaks of their desire to have the best world class service. I am not a rude or unreasonable person. I used to be the Sr. V.P. in charge of customer service for a large company where we strived to protect the company but be fair with our customers. Trust me, Amazon's service is the worst. It’s inexcusable and I’m surprised there hasn’t been a class action lawsuit over inconsistent and unfair practices. Even if you’ve heard positive things about Amazon or you haven't had a problem yourself, just wait. Your turn may be coming. And it may be a horrific experience like mine.",2023,12,December,2023,1,1,0,US

US,"Two items that I ordered on Amazon were never delivered, and when I look at the order status on Amazon, it says ""Your package may be lost.""  This has happened a number of times with other orders.  I called Customer Service to get my lost items replaced, and I spoke with a rep who was nice and polite, but I simply could not understand what she was saying to me.  I had to ask her to repeat what she was saying many, many times, and when she did, I often still could not understand her.  I realize that providing overseas customer support has financial advantages for Amazon, but it is at the expense of customers.

I remember when Customer Service reps were based in the U.S., and they were great and I was able to communicate with them.  My heart sinks every time I have to call Customer Service and I hear someone answer with a heavy accent because I know the interaction is going to be difficult and stressful.  I love  Amazon because of their huge and varied inventory and the ease of ordering from them, but I hate their Customer Service and Amazon delivery services.

US,"I am so upset with amazon. They have ruined a 13 year old girls Christmas.  I have been begging all day to get replacement products and it has been a no go. I don't have alot of money . I struggle but I always make sure to have enough when it comes to the children in my family. My niece made a wishlist so I tried to at least get her several things on there that I could afford. She is 13 and her hair is her everything her. so she wanted a product call Not Your Mother beach babe for curls and she also wanted brittany spears fantasy bodyspray, she loves brittany spears and is a huge fan. To many that's not costly but to me it is because I have numerous children to buy for that's in my family and it adds up. But anways I ordered these products the not your mother comes in, when I opened it the I noticed the plastic looked wet so I open the plastic and this oily stuff was coming out so I cleaned it up off my carpet and when I really looked  the bottles were empty and the lids were barly on. Ok the brittany spears body spray comes in, the lid was busted off and the spray thing did not work. So I call amazon I swallowed my pride and begged and begged for them to replace the products. I explained to them over and over it they were Christmas gufts for my niece. Basically I was told no because I didn't take a picture of the bottles leaking. Who in their right mind thinks of a camera when greasy product is leaking all over their carpet. Ok at that time I didn't know I had to take a picture, who would have known that. I have talked to numerous people on amazon everyone has something different to tell me. I'm very upset because I told them I don't want the money back I just want the products so she has a gift from me. They didn't even care. I cried I was so hurt because I have been a very loyal costumer, I have 4 services with them for the last 2 years. I don't have the words it's Christmas damnit!! I don't have no more to give. A multi billion dollar company couldn't replace 20 dollars worth of products whats wrong with that? It dont even sound normal. Shame on you people at amazon how do u sleep at night knowing you knew the products were damaged when u put them in the boxes.  The only one that will suffer in this is my niece, i guess she supose to open the lid on the body spray and dump it on herself. It's like she is to blame, I guess she is the one who put the damaged products in the boxes knowly they were damaged and gifts at that. I did it for my niece she don't have rich parents they struggle as well. What seems cheap to some may be expensive to another.  I'm sorry for the long review I just want people to know how a multibillion dollar company will take my money quick but at the Sametime won't make it right for the costumer when it was their own company that damaged the products. You should be ashamed of yourselves knowing you don't give a rats ass and that's what really upsets me. Also I want to add they said if they were to decide to give me my money it would be 30 days. Christmas is long gone after 30 days. I just wanted the products they can keep the money that how much this girl means to me. My heart is broke",2023,12,December,2023,1,1,0,US

GB,"Christmas Disappointment – Missing DJI Camera BundleI recently received my parcel, or so I thought. The delivery man left it on the floor and requested I enter a code on his phone. Suspicion arose when the weight felt off, and upon opening it, I discovered baby items instead of the expensive DJI camera bundle set I ordered. The disappointment prompted an immediate call to Amazon customer service, as evident in the attached photo.Despite the tracking indicating a delivery on my street for five hours on 21.12.23, the package mysteriously arrived on 22.12.23. During the redelivery, the delivery person, with limited English proficiency, placed the parcel on the floor and asked me to enter a code on his phone—raising further concerns about the legitimacy of the process.The evident scan became apparent when I noticed the packaging opened too easily, contrary to Amazon's usual tamper-proof measures. This ordeal is especially disheartening as I cannot have children, and the unexpected delivery of baby items shattered my Christmas spirit. The mix-up not only ruined the holiday but also raised questions about the security of Amazon's delivery system.

GB,"There is absolutely no reasonable way to contact Amazon to make a complaint about a blatant lie by one of their delivery drivers. So I'm putting the details here which is the only website that seems to allow me to do so. A note on my Amazon account, presumably from the Amazon delivery driver, says: ""Your package was delivered to a neighbour James at door H Signed by: James.""This is a blatant lie. This is a small block of 8 flats, and there is only one James in the block, and that would be me. The delivery driver is a liar. This is what actually happened.The package was left outside the main security doors where anyone passing by or visiting another tenant could easily have stolen it. Fortunately, it was noticed by a neighbour who brought it to my door. Whilst I had asked for the package to be delivered to my neighbour, I was at home all day. A simple push of either MY bell or my neighbour's, would have got an answer. Instead, the package was left outside the security doors at the front of the building and the driver who delivered it lied about it. As an aside, I ordered something else at the same time as the item above and it was supposed to arrive yesterday. I still haven't got it at the time of writing this review. I will never buy from Amazon again. IMO, the customer service is abysmal. The chatbox 'assistant' (I use the word advisedly) is ludicrous. You simply go round and round in circles and never get to make the comment/s you want to make in the first place.

We were home at number 14 (14 on the house and door) but sadly no one came knocking. The driver decided to take a nice photo of someone else's door and said it was near a greenhouse.  So we got a torch and went out in the cold wet weather to hunt down the parcel. We found it outside a neighbours front porch door  (number 16).

When they did delivery guy decided not to show up and instead logged as ""customer didn't accept the item"" and returned it to Amazon. I called them filed a complaint about it. They investigated and returned with an e-mail that says ""you are right delivery guy did this on his own"". -I asked for replacement. They said there aren't any in stock. -I asked them to send the one which I couldn't even see. After all it was only carried by the delivery guy and its brand new. They said its not possible. Since it labeled as returned amazon sees that as used so they can't do that either.-Then I asked the refund which they already started without even asking me.-6 days past. no refund. I called them again. And the answer is I might have to wait up to a month on the top of this almost a month of waste of time. Because they need to investigate since the amount is bigger then 500 euro.So to summarise it: I have waited for almost a month for them to decide not to deliver.

They claim they need to identify us but they don't seem to need that to take our money!!  That is invasive and opens us up to identity theft in the event they get hacked like everyone else.  I will never give them this!!!  To make matters worse any phone call to customer service takes far too long.  Now, after you've spent 10-15 minutes with a customer service rep they often say they need to transfer the call and you sit in yet another long queue waiting for that person to help and they are less inclined to resolve problem easily putting the burden on the customer.I recently ordered 2 gallons of fuel stabilizer.  After multiple emails that it had been delayed, I called to cancel the order because I was leaving town.  They said they couldn't, but as soon as they could locate te product they would refund my money.  Then, I got emails saying the product ""was likely delivered on December 2nd"", when it wasn't.  They still would not refund my money.  They said I had to wait until after December 12th - almost 2 weeks and I would have to call back and go thru the process all over again.  Finally, after 4 phone calls and over 2 hours of wasted  time, they refunded my money for ""their"" mistake.  Yesterday, I received a $16 item that was not as described online and they wanted a copy of my drivers license or ID.  Well I told them to take a hike.  Instead of placing my next order on Amazon I bought several hundred dollars worth of goods between Walmart and Home Depot and even saved money!!

This also means that if you have relatives with Dementia that they can monetise the system in immoral ways. You can no longer register a new account on behalf of a customer you care for with Dementia or other challenges as if you have an account you would need a new account but can not use same mobile phone number. Most people have just one mobile phone. It is time people leave Amazon and shop somewhere where ethics are correct.

CA,"Buyer bewareDO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON,  I purchased a bunch of items from Amazon and  when I went to open the undamaged , not tampered box, which looked exactly like the picture taken by the delivery personnel and what was attached on my Amazon order saying delivered . I was missing one item. The one item missing that I ordered was an easy bake oven .I originally wanted to order from Walmart as it was cheaper ($59.97) but it was sold out everywhere but on Amazon it was $185.xx approx with some extra items food items for the easy bake oven but it was in stock.Other items in that box that I received,costed more than the easy bake oven.When I called Amazon to let them know that one item was not in the box but everything else was , they told me I had to file a police report.Which they believe it was stolen and I had to file a report .I don’t believe it was stolen , it was just not sent by Amazon . So I filed a Police report anyways cause Amazon won’t give me my money back to get a new one until I file a police report and to boot it’s now a week away from Christmas .I sent the incident number by email which I filed with the police department before 10am on Friday dec 15th,2023 and I also told the Amazon customer service rep that I would be calling back after work as I would like an update . When I called back after work the lovely lady listened to my story and tried to call the police department at that time but because it was after 6pm the police department was no longer open . They had since 10 am in the morning to call but no Amazon customer service rep called and now I have to wait over the weekend . Now, I have to  call back on Monday and go through the same process for a missing easy bake oven that I believe they never had or sent. Plus, I have to go and try and find another one somewhere over the weekend .Amazon packaging tape is so unbelievably hard to get off on any package , the package I received was in perfect condition and the whole box was on my porch. There was no question in my mind that the package was open or tampered with. Now, I have to go through all the extra work and stress for something that was never put in the package in the first place . If someone was going to steal anything would they not just take the entire box or pick the more expensive items in the box and wouldn’t the box be damaged ?????All good questions that three + managers at Amazon cannot answer or help with. They don’t have a picture of the package inside before it left Amazon but a picture of the package/box on my porch from the delivery personel , which looks exactly how it was when I received it .I will not be purchasing anymore from Amazon … I received all my products that were suppose to be in my package except for one item and I am the one that has to do all the work and file a police report for something I believe was not stolen . I believe Amazon didn’t sent it . Which is more suspicious is that Walmart was sold out everywhere in the GTA. Which makes me think… did they even have any easy bake ovens and what’s the chances that the one thing I am missing is what was sold out from Walmart .. hmmmmm makes you think 🤔????Recommend not to buy from Amazon",2023,12,December,2023,1,1,0,CA

GB,"I am glad that I am able to write a review for Amazon, the hardest part is finding the correct Amazon (with me living in the UK), and a search for Amazon revealed pages and pages of Amazons', all linked, with different country extensions etc.Anyway, despite the negative feedback, and there seems to be an awful lot here, PLUS, despite the feedback about what goes on in the background, I have to say I am delighted with Amazon. Truly, they have never let me down, deliver ALWAYS on time, keep me updated all the way too, and so easy if a return is needed.I see our Amazon drivers every day struggling in this constant traffic, literally stood still at times on motorways and peak time, and yet they still raise a smile, and deliver all the goods to the correct place even following any instructions for safe places.This Christmas 2023, (at the time of the review), they will be busier than ever, and yet they still deliver, even up to 10pm at night.

I have yet to ever receive an order the same day after selecting that option umpteen times. Amazon may as well remove this option since it's an out and out lie.When I rang up to find out more, I was told ""well, you ordered it this morning so it's going to be next-day delivery.' Tried to convince me that I didn't see the words 'ARRIVE TONIGHT BY 10PM' as I hit order. I didn't select next day delivery as I knew I wouldn't be available.Frustrating experience - don't get your hopes up with that is all I can say on that.The couriers are hopeless. They rarely knock and will happily leave your parcel out on the street. When they do knock, they expect you to instantly teleport to the door, seeing as they give you a nanosecond to open the door after ringing your doorbell.

Finding out I had purchased to the German site. Of course, one might assume gift cards could be redeemed wherever, but no. It has to be with the place of purchase, and they have also blocked ability to purchase gift card with other gift cards and you guessed it - no refunds. So, money is now locked and completely unusable to my friend just relocating to Australia. I cannot over-stress the utter dissatisfaction experienced when your frankly laughable self-help/ chat bot customer service is not even able to provide the simplest of answers.

GB,"I ordered an IPad Air from Amazon (the company itself rather than a Marketplace seller) on 24th November. It was meant to be my daughter’s Christmas present and it cost several hundred pounds. It should have been delivered to me on 26th November, though instead I was delivered a box of opened dry cat food. I presume that an Amazon employee somewhere along the chain took the IPad and replaced it with the cat food that they emptied to an equivalent weight.I phoned Amazon Customer Services on 26th November and explained what had happened. I asked I be sent an actual IPad Air, though was told I could only be refunded the money, and only once Amazon had “received my return” (the cat food). UPS collected the cat food from me on 27th and delivered it to Amazon on 28th November.Two and a half weeks and several phone calls to Amazon down the line I was told today that “hopefully” I should be refunded my money on 3rd January 2024 (38 days after I’d initially explained to Amazon what had happened and “returned” the item).Each Amazon Customer Services person over the past couple of weeks has treated me indifferently, as if I’m a customer who has returned an unwanted book rather than someone who has essentially been defrauded by an Amazon employee. In actual fact I’ve been treated worse than someone returning an unwanted book, as if it had been a low cost item that was being refunded I would have been reimbursed within 14 days, rather than it taking more than a month because of the financial cost involved. I have kept on being told to “be patient” and that I’ll be refunded in 5 to 10 days, though the date keeps being put back for no reason that anyone has explained, and now for some reason I won’t be refunded until 2024. It means my daughter will be without a Christmas present this year. No one at Amazon seems particularly bothered or sympathetic.I might continue to buy inexpensive items from Amazon that I can’t easily get elsewhere, though I certainly won’t be buying anything expensive from them again.

Told customer service rep to call police department. She said if they can verify then can get refund. Gets back on phone and said that they did verify it but since they could not tell her if I made the report they could not verify my identity. Funny how it changed again. Called a manager and he said the police report is valid and before report is a signed form from me to get police report verifying it is me plus he said legally rep is not suppose ask for my identity.

I have now canceled everything to do with Amazon. I have thrown my Alexis in the trashcan. My fire sticks are in the trashcan and I want nothing ever to do with anything Amazon.

GB,Bought from Amazon.com for the first time but was not impressed by the care and attention to the packaging of my items. I bought some masters of the universe figures which had there bubbles lifted off the card back I was not impressed and expected them to be in better condition they were squashed into a small box and packaged inconsiderately. I contacted Amazon.co.uk who said they would ask someone from Amazon.com to contact me regarding my damaged figures. To be quite honest they were not bothered or didn’t care and didn’t offer resolution if it had been Amazon.co.uk they would have arranged replacement or partial refund. Not impressed with the Yanks customer services wouldn’t recommend buying your carded figures from Amazon.com.,2023,12,November,2023,48,1,0,GB

All you receive are these mindless automated responses that clearly demonstrate they couldn't care less about your problem. It's like talking to a brick wall; no matter how detailed you are in explaining the issue, they just brush you off. Their sole purpose seems to be getting you off the line ASAP, hoping you'll magically forget about your problem and suffer in silence. It's a disgrace!",2023,12,December,2023,2,1,0,Other

Cheap prices are no good if your purchases arrive in such a state. Most my big purchases this year have been with other companies, all of whom package their goods properly. I will now try and buy my dvd’s elsewhere where possible - I already buy most my books from other sellers for that reason, which is rather ironic as that is how Amazon started. So until they start to pack things properly I will try to only buy things off them where condition isn’t so important! GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER AMAZON!",2023,12,December,2023,44,1,0,GB

AU,"I would give it a 0/5 star rating if I could as their Accessibility, ease of use and neurodiverse options are limited when you ask for help for Prime Video. It is very confusing to have to click a whole bunch of tabs and then find out they don't have a message box or email address. Amazon also has no formal complaint process that is easy to find. False advertising that you can email them. I went through every drop-down bar, and not once did the email light up. I did not want people contact today as it is my day to watch series or read my ebooks and wanted to report a strange IT glitch by email/message that I felt confused me and didn't really fit any of their drop down bars. Not Amazon Video, Kindle or main website provide help message boxes or email addresses. You only have the option to speak on chat and mobile. The help page takes 5-8 clicks. You type in Binge contact us and their email address is easy to find in Google. Paramount has their easy to access email address on their international website, Everand has I think either easy to find email address through google search or a message box. Use these websites.

Each new person would read the same basic script (try logging out and logging back in).  Eventually got to some manager type.

I can’t even cancel them!!!!!! Amazon figured out a loophole how to keep your money and not ship the orders!!

US,"1. You never get correct delivery date when ordering so if your like I am and order on certain days so you can plan delivery on a certain day, just hang it up.Every order they ship gives you a bogus deliver date then you get an email update stating delivery date has changed. ""Surprise"" we don't care if you made special arrangements for the planned date given at time of order! Scrambled and rearrange you schedules and life to cater to our shipping needs.  You have to pay extra to have a set delivery day such as over night....  Why is it too much to ask a major shipping company to properly relay shipping times on standard shipments? 2. Trying to present this question in Amazon help was a joke! Hence the 1 star rating. You don't actually get to post your question or provde written answers, you select canned responses which plainly says: they don't want any feed back on Amazon company only option is to give feedback on sellers with Amazon's suggested issues and gee dont have a question outside of the 4 answers they provide. So, they don't get a true picture and don't care because it cost too much money to actually provide real customer service and not an AI canned response!",2023,12,December,2023,3,1,0,US
