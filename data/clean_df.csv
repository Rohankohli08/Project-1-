62,US,Unreliable Service and Pricing Discrepancy,"I typically don't take the time to share reviews, but my recent experience with Amazon has been deeply frustrating and deserves to be addressed.As an HVAC business, I rely heavily on timely and reliable deliveries. I placed an order for a 16"" duct, which was crucial for one of our ongoing projects. The order came with a guaranteed delivery date that Amazon failed to meet. After several unsuccessful attempts to reach Amazon (with no accessible customer service contact numbers or direct support options), I was forced to contact the third-party seller directly. The seller assured me that the product had been dispatched on time and advised me to resolve the issue with Amazon. Despite being provided with a phone number that I could not find anywhere on Amazon’s platform, I eventually managed to speak with an Amazon representative. I was informed that the product had been lost, and while a refund was issued, the real issue remains unresolved.I need the material, not just a refund. When I attempted to reorder the product, I discovered that the price had increased by $150 — an unjustifiable increase given the circumstances. I explained the situation to the representative, emphasizing that I had already quoted my customer the original price and could not go back to them with an unexplained price hike. In summary, my experience with Amazon has been one of misleading pricing, unreliable delivery, and a lack of customer support. This has caused significant delays for my business and damaged my relationship with my customer.I expect Amazon to resolve this by honoring the original price and ensuring the prompt delivery of the product.Sincerely,  Alex Garcia  Attic Crawl Inc.",2024,09,September,2024,3.0,1.0,low

121,US,Account Specialist Inquisition Strikes Again!,"Yesterday, I received the most random email from my inquisition friends over at Amazon's crooked ""account specialist"" team, who are literally dredging up old disputes from last year to try and recharge for them. It just so happens that UPS only keeps tracking records for 120 days. Well Amazon is trying to collect on a dispute that my bank closed-out in my favor about 456 days later. Their account specialist randomly acted like it was a new dispute, even though it's from more than a year ago. I haven't made any returns for the last seven months, and recently made two returns, so I think Amazon is trying to retaliate against me for no reason other than that this is their latest maneuver to try and goad me into rethinking legitimate returns.Background on Dispute: This item was confirmed through UPS back then as having arrived at an Amazon facility. Amazon resisted against refunding me, citing that the item never arrived, contrary to clear evidence at the time. Chase Bank resolved things in my favor after I produced all the evidence. I have none of it on hand anymore, as this was a closed matter in my eyes, especially 456 days after the fact.I have filed complaints with the FTC, the BBB, and am working on a state attorney general complaint, after Amazon sends over my request archive of data. I am not going to allow a billion dollar company to bully me over a $16.91 dispute. The sheer pettiness of it, but if Amazon is doing this to multiple consumers, and many of us are subconsciously reconsidering making returns or accepting losses for defective items or Amazon's mishandling of a return, then Amazon is winning in trying to minimize the number of returns in the most odious way possible.",2024,09,September,2024,1.0,1.0,low

I waited for the door to go but nothing happened although i did see the colour of the delivery guys jacket heading back down the close stairs. I assumed it must have been a delivery for next door and thought no more of it for 5 minutes. Then my phone went to tell me my package was delivered!!!! News to me so I opened the door and in the middle of my step was my package. The driver made no attempt to ring the bell or knock the door and the same thing happened with yesterdays delivery.If this happens again the item will be returned to amazon for a full refund as i am not in the habit of buying things with a huge risk attached on whetheri receive it or not.I called amazon customer services who were more interested in getting me to jump through hoops than help. After doing all the account verification before speaking to the advisor she was unwilling to help unless i went through all the security again. Pathetic.

The two most common complaints I have to give, and the most annoying -1. Orders being delayed or outright being lost. I had an order that was out for delivery, then it kept being delayed until I was told it would arrive by 10pm, then it was delayed by two days, and the same thing just happened but this time delayed by four days. How can an order be OUT FOR DELIVERY and then end up being delayed by days?2. The refund system. I was told by an automated service that I'd be refunded for said cases above, but the system then told me I'd be refunded once the items are returned. I contacted one of the agents and questioned how can I return something that didn't arrive, and thankfully they agreed and refunded me. I don't know what's changed internally, but Amazon used to have reliable delivery and a reliable refund system. In the past months it's just completely gone downhill. I won't be using them from here on out. Do yourself a favour and use one of the many alternatives that now exist, there are plenty of great websites out there that are currently much better.

I've never given anything but accurate honest reviews and if you're going to start silencing customers I'm filing a complaint with BBB and letting everyone on social media know. Postmaster showed me the labels they use are created on Photoshop and then customer has to pay $12.43 for shipping cause the seller didn't pay the postage.

NOT TO MENTION, I never ordered a 2nd pair and they not only charged me for them but then I had to pay postage. Same thing happened with 1st order. I returned those and only. Got back something like $12 which didn't even cover the postage. You need to stop silencing customers who have valid warnings and only. Post truthful reviews. I will not take the horrible way you've been treating me, freezing my account and now removed every review i ever posted plus I'll never be allowed to post a review again. I'm filing a complaint with BBB because your reasoning is unfounded and If I need to I will file a lawsuit for discrimination.

I followed the advice of the manufacturer and nothing worked. The radio was operating well, however I noticed that there were scuff marks on one side and the screw where the Lithium battery was looked like it had been tampered with. I called Amazon first since I didn’t have a receipt or the address where the products were shipped to. Amazon immediately responded that I had to have proof of purchase to return and that after 30 days I needed to take the issue to the manufacture. Tough Light never responded to a message I left them and after sending an email expressing the diverse issues, there position was that in order to return and replace I needed to have proof of purchase. I know that every product sold has a unique number and ToughLight could have easily verified if the product I have was sold through Amazon m. That ended the story!

Further aggravating the situation is the unhelpful customer service that provides no meaningful guidance on correcting the supposed issues with my reviews.Despite my appreciation for the value of the products I purchased, the deficient and opaque review process, coupled with a customer service team that gives no definitive answers, has led me to the point of exasperation. Consequently, I am no longer inclined to dedicate my time to crafting new reviews. Instead, I find myself compelled to voice my discontent here. Amazon, unfortunately, has earned this negative feedback due to their lackluster service and unfavorable approach to customer and seller relations.",2024,09,September,2024,21.0,1.0,low

159,GB,Bunch of SCAMMERS,"I cannot believe that I am actually moved to call AMAZON a bunch of SCAMMERS.  I placed an order for an item yesterday evening.  It was on a price offer until midnight and would be delivered the next day (today).  I just happened to look at my orders and saw that it would, now, not be delivered for another TWENTY FOUR DAYS.  On the order page, I clicked on the image of the item - read that again slowly, ON THE  ORDER  PAGE,  I  CLICKED  ON  THE  IMAGE  OF  THE  ITEM  and it took me back to it, SHOWING THAT I HAD BOUGHT IT THE DAY BEFORE but it was now back to its original price AND WITH NEXT DAY DELIVERY.  I called amazon to query this and was told that I could cancel the order re-place it and my item would arrive the next day.  But, of course, I would have to pay the higher price.  No amount of arguing seemed to be able to answer the question of how EXACTLY the same item can be delivered next day at the higher price, but at the offer price I paid the previous day I would have to wait over three weeks.  Insanity.  I demanded to speak to the agent's supervisor and, after more arguing, I was put through.  The supervisor, after more arguing and trying to get through to him the ridiculousness of the situation, was magnanimous enough to offer me the difference in a gift card if I cancelled and re-placed the order.  I don't want an effing gift card, I want the item at the price I paid and with the delivery time advertised on the listing at the time I paid for it.  Is that too much to ask?  What they did, by anyone's definition, was a SCAM and I have now deleted my account.",2024,09,September,2024,70.0,1.0,low
160,US,I used to like Amazon a lot... not anymore,"I used to like Amazon a lot, in their early years they couldn't be beat because of their quality of service, but things have really changed in my opinion, and they keep getting worse.For the 3rd time this year I've had an order get delayed.  I understand that that's part of mail-ordering... but there's always somethings that are ""hinky"" about the delays. For instance, I received a confirmation 20 hours ago that the items had just shipped and that I could expect them today. Just now, I received a delay notice that it ""should"" arrive in 5 days. (How did it get delayed overnight?) And the other delays were similarly nonsensical.I've worked in shipping & receiving positions a lot, in my career days, so I get that odd things can happen, in fact odd can be rather normal in the ""business"". So, I'm unconvinced that the reasons behind any of my recent delayed shipments were the ""normal sort of odd"".The thing with Amazon and their sellers is that there's a rather long waiting period when an item gets delayed before they'll consider it lost and grant a refund or whatever. Also, they don't take the loss/delay seriously like they used to do back in the day. And to add to that, there's really no place on the Amazon site to comment about their site (as if they care about the customer) ... I've always hated looking at the reviews about an item, only to read about shipping issues... now I understand why.So, a month or so ago, I quit Amazon Prime because paying for better shipping privileges when the shipping services were cruddy didn't make sense. But what am I to do when I want to quit this corporate juggernaut that we've built... they pretty much own the market.",2024,09,September,2024,2.0,1.0,low

He sent a return label in which I would have to pay over 30.00 to ship back as well as a restocking fee. I again called Amazon and again they said they would take care of. This time the seller would not respond after 48hours. Again I was told it would be taken care of. The next day I got an email telling me the breadmaker was stolen and I would have to get a police report to them I stressed that I had several conversations with them already about this breadmaker and it was not stolen.  The next day I received the same email saying I need the police report.  I called again. This time in complete frustration. A john came on and then said I would need to deal with the seller to resolve now. Or he could put a certain percentage on my Amazon account if I kept the breadmaker.  What??? All I wanted as a consumer was to return a defective item and have my money returned. I received a message today from their A Z department that my claim was denied.

Well what a surprise they have sent me another message saying it’s been rescheduled till Monday, so I rang up and told them to cancel it now they’re saying I’ve got wait nearly a week to get my refund. It’s ridiculous. Why would you place any more orders with a company? If they’re not going to deliver it? I don’t think they understand the concept.. sadly their customer services got worse that I didn’t think it could get. I had to repeat myself to the person nine times and he still didn’t seem to understand that I had a pending payment which means I sadly could not access my money and was told by the bank that I needed a code from him so it could be cancelled or they could cancel it for me either way he refused to do it. He said I just had to ring my bank like I haven’t done that numerous times before now. I have money that I can’t even get to sat there pending. I hate Amazon and I will never use them again they are disgusting. I even asked him if I could put a complaint in because I don’t think he understood when I said I needed the payment pending cancelled. I want to close the account and I cannot do that until this is done. I would never order from this company ever again because now they’re holding my money and I can’t even get to it my bank said without an authorisation code they could not close it themselves so I had to ring Amazon and get them to do it directly which they are refusing to do so my money is just sat there in limbo sadly unimpressed quite wound up and my birthday is tomorrow.

However fake reviews abound and there are a lot of scams, some obvious, which they don't seem too keen to root out - for example: any number of SD cards which trick your computer or phone into thinking it has a terabyte or even more of extra memory but really only has a fraction of that, and which corrupt your files when the real limit is reached. I decided to part company with Amazon when their customer service department contradicted itself, claiming that my account could not be restored when just the previous evening someone from the accounts department had been on the verge of doing precisely that, lacking only immediate access to my email for verification (unfortunately I was away from my computer at the time). I was told I now needed to set up a new account, but in doing so I now stand to lose several years of accumulated Kindle books. On account of this dire, confused and unhelpful customer service and the prevalence of scams and fakery I can only rate Amazon at 2 stars even though you can buy anything there and the app is easy to use.

I have a few experiences LAST YEAR: I do Christmas shopping early, and I homeschool so my kids are with me all the time and well i thought Amazon would be convenient source. Upon going through my packages, i had noticed i was sold used boys underwear, I usually use the chat option and the girl started to interrogate me and said i had to send a photo of my license, i was like no, so i called instantly and I got this girl and she said no, and “supposedly” gave me 50 promo to repurchase the underwear, well…. It never got added to my account, never i went through associate after associate, one in which screamed so loudly at me and blamed me of lying and then hung up, finally i got this girl who said i had used it, so I asked her on what she goes a toolbox for a back of a truck it was used in part of that order, i assured her that i indeed did not own a truck…. And that my account must of been hacked, i got through associate after associate, nothing was done at all, in fact the Hanes company themselves refunded me for the underwear sent me replacements, i did get a call from there higher up office and they have me a $50 gift balance, well ok it gets even better, i get my son a gaming laptop $800, the seller was very unreasonable, the associate promised it was A-Z well needless to say we had to send this laptop out and have if fixed $400 in extra damages, finally after i complained so much they wrote us a letter to dispute he charges on our card, after that i bought some leggings, there was a whole in the leggings, the associate said I must of been so heavy i stretched them out and i could not get a refund.  Half of the items i got last year were either not as described by the sellers or just used and retaped back up and sold as new. Then they sold me a pairs of winter boots, and there was white power all over them i complained about those too….i sent items back and didn’t get a return they kept it numerous times, i had to involve the bbb to get anywheres Well this year i decided nope no way am i going to deal with Amazon, well i found a wahl clipper set i paid $200 for this set, it took a gouge of skin out of my husbands head, amazon refused to refund me because i was one day over the deadline. I had to go to bbb for that i just sent it back and finally they did refund me after a fight, but they wanted me to contact the company,So i decided well I’m going to go to Walmart for know on they have all the same items and it will be much easier to return if necessary, but with dread a few items Walmart did not have so I had to purchase with Amazon, i ordered a camera bundle for 141.58 it came with accessories, well upon opening my back there’s no accessories, so well i thought ill deal with the seller, usually there earlier they will just send what’s missing, i talk to the seller and he’s just unreasonable, saying he can’t send it because it will cost him money. Like no reason at all, well with complete dread i chat with amazon and speak with an agent named Joey Mae, he was polite and gave me two options 1. I return for a replacement, or 2, they give me half a refund to my original payment method. I chose option 2, he said id get a email…… well waiting no email, then another agents said the same thing, no email, then the 3rd said they approved it and ill be getting back 64.58 and i should get a email. I got a email there like return it for 141.58 for a full refund and you’ll have to repurchase the item, so i wrote back and said there must be a mistake and told them and shared the screenshots i took, because i had one to many ptsd experiences, there like no we have to take this to a higher level. So i called and got this English lady who screams at me has me on hold for 20mins and just comes back yelling. I wrote to the highest up, and they still didn’t budge even with the screen shots as proof, so i took it to the bbb, and still will not budge, so I’m out 141.58. Also they sold me toy in the same order that was used and the amount of dust on it was so thick you could write your name in it, and it was stabbed repeated over and over again with something sharp, i was able to send photos of that and they replaced that and told me to keep and donate the other one.They changed there return policy around know they use a QR code and you take your item to the ups store and they scan it do all the packaging, I live in a rural area, the nearest ups store is 2 hours away, and you have to pay $7.99 to print your own label, and $14.99 to have ups pick up at your door.

I immediately removed these, changed my password and attempted to contact customer service, impossible to find a phone number so ended up on their chat, this is when the problem really started, transferred 4 times eventually told not to answer any emails or txt , nothing remotely to do with my problem.

220,CA,Amazon customer service has sunk to new lows,"   Amazon customer service has sunk to new depths.  It seems the general approach is to throw out random explanations, no matter how untrue,  and hope one of them sticks.  Writing to executives is not helpful, as they just throw your issue to some Executive Response team, manned by the same low competence.    My issue stems from a google play gift card order via Amazon for an important birthday.  Two days after the order was accepted, and on the day the gift card was due to be delivered, it was arbitrarily cancelled.    The following saga ensues as I repeatedly contact customer service with two simple questions:  Why was the order cancelled and who cancelled it-  Agent says it was damaged in transit .... it’s an electronic gift card -  Same agent says I cancelled the order .... this is not the case -  Same agent says they can’t track anything as the order is over 30 days old .... the order was placed 5 days earlier -  The supervisor can’t figure out what happened and promises a response within 48 hours .... no response was ever received -  I escalate to CS-escalation and am told “not our problem, talk to the marketplace vendor for a refund.” ... refund was not the issue -  I escalate up the executive chain and i receive a response saying the payment was rejected by my bank.   I proceed to demonstrate that payment was in fact taken but reimbursed two days later  ... so not a rejection from the bank -  A different agent agrees that it was not a payment rejection and promises a response by Aug 20 ... I receive a response Aug 22-  The response states “an error on our end processing this refund” ... refund was not the issue  In short, terrible customer service and executives who don’t care about your experience.   Amazon has grown too big and indolent to care about quality.

I became a Amazon prime member when it came out...now after nearly 15+ years, customer service is burried deep in the AI bullsh*t and when you do reach a customer rep, they will promise to send 'return labels' which will never arrive.  If you try to reach out again - they will apologize and say 'we will send the labels' and still NOTHING comes.  This is probably a tactic to avoid returns but the ease of returns is what made Amazon successful and earned loyal customers like me.What happened to Amazon the company I fell in love those 15 years ago?",2024,08,August,2024,3.0,2.0,low

He had texted me for the code but your instructions clearly say not to give by phone but to read to driver upon delivery. He was in front of my house for seconds before he drove off and went to a neighbor's house. I flagged him down. He said his instructions were different from mine (he expected me to respond almost immediately to his text and text him the code). Ridiculous. He then stopped in front of my house and got out of the truck with the printer. I gave him the code - he scanned the barcode - and I carried it down my driveway. I waited around yesterday and he took off in a similar fashion without coming to the door. Today I waited all day and tracked him to the house so I was able to respond immediately, or I would have no printer.

You pay monthly fee for faster shipping, but then theres a 99% chance your item will be damaged from mishandling by drivers / shippers, or were in damaged, unsellable condition to begin with. I've seen drivers throw packages at people's doors! Shippers dont bother to even think about what they're packing so there will be insufficient padding to protect from drivers' mishandling or their intentional damage when throwing items. I cant order anything that i want to arrive in brand new unbroken condition. The only things i can order are things that can handle a little bit of a beating in transit, but thats barely anything. Order a ""brand new"" blu ray, receive a previously opened blu ray that was shrinkwrapped and melted with a heat gun. Order a brand new book, get a book that was completely destroyed from bouncing around in a box 3x its size with no padding or all messed up from being in a soft bubble wrap envelope, and that is if they arent completely destroyed by the shipper/fullfillment center. Believe it or not, but amazon used to have special packaging for books and movies so that they dont get damaged but nobody in this self-serving megacorporation cares anymore. 98% of items are off-brand chinese products that belong at a 99 cent store that are priced as high as the real brand-name products they're disguising themselves as. These products break either right away or very shortly after return windows. They typically ship with some type of offer for gift cards in exchange for reviews, padding up the reviews of their inferior products. The product page makes them appear as a brand name product, but the item comes in a generic unsealed box. You would get better at five below but it was priced at $40. This is pretty much the entire store. Trusted brands with names like, ""gOOprOO"", ""WYdaiBother"" are amazons recommended choice. It is no longer worth doing business with amazon, who are obviously unwilling to address the issues customers are complaining about with a too-big-to-fail attitude.

The first product was 5 days shipping and the day before delivery the shipper broke some of the bottles--not Amazon's fault, obviously. The problem was how Amazon handled it. When I called, they told me they communicated to the company to initiate the replacement now, so it could be delivered  by the following Saturday. By the next day I still did not see a status change on the Amazon app for the product, so I called again--I was told by the person that she ""guaranteed"" I would receive the replacement by Saturday. Saturday arrived and still no change in shipping status to indicate the item was shipped--in fact, the only update was to state I was receiving a refund--so I called Amazon again. The first agent lied to me and tried to tell me he could ""help"" by initiating a refund (the refund had already been initiated the day before). I had the call escalated and I was told the item was never replaced and that none of the agents should have told me what they did. It was also too late to order that item as new orders would arrive after the surgery date. I looked for a different clear protein drink (that isn't red or purple). By now the surgery was only a few days away. The item I found indicated it could be delivered same day, between 5 and 10 p.m. Eureka, I thought. I ordered it. Of course it didn't arrive. That night the app updated to say that it would be delivered by 8 a.m. the next day. It wasn't. I called Amazon again. This time they have no idea why the item wasn't delivered and they still had no idea if or when the item might be delivered today. I had the call escalated. She didn't know either. She also couldn't reach the area that handles shipping to find out when the item would be shipped. She ended up refunding the first item (while not canceling it) and recommending a new order be put in to try to get the item delivered by this afternoon--halfway through the clear liquids day. I did as she suggested and put the second order it, but I really have very little confidence  Amazon can make it happen anymore. Unfortunately, these are not the only examples of failed and late deliveries with this company. It's become commonplace. While I was on the phone with the escalation team, I submitted my order for the first items I am moving to Walmart and away from Amazon. I will find replacements for the rest of my items and then cancel Prime before the end of the month. For those who may be holding off on canceling Prime because you like the streaming, be aware that after you cancel you can pay for a streaming-only option for $9 a month--less than the $15 a month or so we pay for Prime shipping. If I find the streaming worth keeping (TBD), that is what I will switch to. The rest of the company isn't worth my hard-earned money anymore. Moving on.",2024,08,August,2024,2.0,1.0,low

I have tried to resolve this issue by calling Amazon many times didn't help. According to Amazon customer service, they agreed that I should get a refund and also, they tried to refund with Amazon store gift card but due to the limitations on their system, they couldn't. They should have another solution but surprisingly they don't. I found these things after calling them multiple times (remember 6 times) talking with first phase customer service and also supervisors as well.Then, my husband reached out to Amazon Prime Credit Card (Chase Bank CC) to dispute this transaction since I used my husband's amazon prime credit card. He spoke with the Credit Card customer server but couldn't resolve it since according to them, it should be less than 118 days from the item received. I received an item on March 7 that means it has already passed 118 days. I was working with Amazon customer service to resolve this, and it took around 2 months. Nobody will know this time limit for the dispute though. So, we were not able to dispute and get a refund through the CC company too.I have proof of returned item delivery on June 7 through UPS tracking.I also have the proof of Amazon return policy and instructions that says, ""All items must be sent by Jun 7, 2024.""",2024,08,August,2024,1.0,1.0,low

452,US,Amazon is a harmful scam,"I’ve been an Amazon customer for many years, and after over a decade, I need to say something about my experiences. Whether this message reaches many or not, I’m sharing my direct experience. Amazon is undeniably convenient, fast, and easy to use, but it comes with serious risks, including fraud, financial theft, and receiving dangerous products. Using Amazon is like gambling with your money. I’ve had Amazon commit fraudulent transactions, charging me double and triple what I should have paid, which I had to sort out with my bank and they confirmed Amazon has been doing this to me. I’ve ordered a wide range of products from Amazon, and it's always a hit or miss regarding quality. I’ve even been hospitalized after receiving extremely foul food and drink products from Amazon. For instance, condiment sauces were so spoiled and contaminated that they nearly unalived me.I’ve encountered countless instances of products being falsely advertised and misrepresented by Amazon and its sellers—everything from grills and clothing to dolls, groceries, electronics, health items, automotive parts, sports gear and more. I’ve been defrauded multiple times over the years, with a recent example being defective and dysfunctional devices sold through numerous sellers. They just robbed me again of thousands of dollars for electronics. It’s clear that Amazon is aware of these issues because many others have been scammed in the same way. Amazon takes our money and delivers trash. Returning items is a hassle, and it's not always feasible for people.Amazon allows these fraudulent sellers to operate and benefits from their schemes. These sellers are slick, and anyone who has dealt with them knows what I’m talking about. The same applies to Amazon's customer service. It’s some kind of business model to take a bunch of money and provide devices that doesn’t work. This shouldn’t be legal. I’m not a legal expert, but this ongoing issue can’t be right.While I have received some good products from Amazon, the negative experiences far outweigh the positives. This is crazy.

480,US,If you can find it elsewhere you should. This is why. ,Through out the years Amazon continues on its trend downwards. What blows my mind is that even with this disgusting rating I’m willing to bet many people here still purchase from Amazon. Which is why ratings some times are meaningless. Here is the issues:1. Prime shipping. Perfect for home delivery a freaking nightmare for apartment delivery. Plus their whole logistic side is ran by partners and has the lowest moral on earth. So basically every time you purchase something you’re asking an angry employee to take it deliver to you. Can you see why instructions aren’t followed and there is a high rate of shipping failures mostly to apartment buildings? 2. Through the years brand names became less and knocks became the focus. And to make sure you’re forced to go for the knock offs guess what they deeply discount the knock offs while keeping brand prices high. It’s a tactic that makes sure they always win and you lose. 3. Support is non existent. People found a way to get around it and escalate so they patch it back to the incompetent support team. People found another way to escalate they patched that too bringing it back to the same disgusting support team. So people found ways to reach their dispatch side to better track things. So Amazon again closed that off and forward the number to support. You could email the ceo directly to escalate that email doesn’t work anymore. Would could go to consumer protection or BBB or any other way short of a lawsuit it falls on death ears. Meaning they made it so the incompetent support team is your only communication to them. And to clarify I say incompetent because they don’t train the team or give them tools to resolve the issue. What we see on the app is the only information support is also given. 4. Decreased same day shipping. Majority of times if I need something it’s now labeled as a two day prime shipping. And the continue to decrease shipping through other carriers to the point it is almost strictly just prime shipping. And prime shipping is worthless. 5. The route items through warehouses that can be multiple hours away from you when they have warehouses next door to you. This pissed off drivers who then have no incentive to deliver your package on time. And if they run late even though you asked for same day your package will be 2 days late. 6. They don’t care about being customer based they are following the ways of every other tech company out there. Going from having an awesome reputation to no reputation at all. None. Or having the bottom of the barrel worst reputation ever. Point is Amazon has no incentive do lift a finger. They are just going to continue to push crap even with the federal government investigating them it still won’t do a thing for them. This is what happens when a company becomes too big without being regulated more strictly. They become dangerous and unstoppable. If you can find the item elsewhere I strongly suggest getting it there. For me tech needs I go to tech stores around the area. Sure higher prices but I don’t care. At least there is no headaches. I go in I grab the box of what I need I pay for it and that’s it. ,2024,08,August,2024,28.0,1.0,low

496,US,Unreliable and untrustworthy,"We've been Amazon customers since we were in school many, many years ago. Today's Amazon is no longer a store we feel safe shopping at. Just some highlights.We frequently get items that are different from their advertisements--and for the worse. Many items fail within the first few months, but when we look back at our order history to review the ad, the company that had offered the items is no longer on Amazon. Suspicious. We can't trust Amazon reviews anymore. Lots of low quality foreign goods with 4.5 and 4.6 star reviews, but too many of these reviewed products we buy turn out to be trash that can't even last 3-months. Whenever we write a positive review, Amazon publishes it without a hitch. But most of our negative reviews are flagged and removed, despite our not finding any justification for this in Amazon's own review guidelines. No Amazon rep ever gets back to us to explain what's up.Amazon's customer service is unreliable. We've lost track of how many times a chat support agent has given us instructions and promised us we can trust them, but later it turns out they were wrong. And we have to bear the financial cost of THEIR wrong instructions. Even when issues are elevated to ""supervisors,"" we've been given false information that's cost us money. Today, Amazon is often just unwilling to compensate customers hurt because of Amazon's or Amazon's reps' errors.About one in three items delivered to our home arrives damaged. So the gas we waste driving long distances to Amazon return drop off centers adds up. Why are we PAYING resources to return Amazon's junk? No more.Amazon HAS WRONGLY CHARGED OUR CREDIT CARD for items we have proof were returned to Amazon because, so customer support supervisors have told us, this trillion-dollar company can't keep track of its own shipping network. So the customer ends up wrongly paying for it. Google it--several US state attorneys generals have taken or are taking legal action for Amazon wrongly charging customers for items that were timely and correctly returned.I could go on and on. Once, Amazon was THE STORE our family could rely on--not just to get what we wanted, but to be treated fairly, to be able to trust what Amazon's reps, especially supervisors, told us. No more. And now it's costing us more money to do business with Amazon than we save by not shopping elsewhere.So after decades of shopping on Amazon, we've closed our account and aren't looking back.

I sent an order to a customer as per delivery address. It couldn't be delivered because of a insufficient address. I asked the customer to pay for re delivery and what does this disgusting company called Amazon do. They refund the customer in full making me lose out on the shipping from the customer's address and back to me. Disgraceful.

The guy straight up said, ""you were lied to, there is no refund. The extra charge was to cover your order"". I informed the guy that I was saving the conversation and phone calls and reporting fraud to my card company, which I did.

585,GB,Appalling Customer Service When dealing Security ,"Appalling Customer Service When dealing with the Security of Your Property I was an Amazon Prime customer for 5 years, and after 4 months of couriers ignoring delivery instructions, asked Amazon to take action on drivers that refuse to to do so, as it was causing a security problem.It's important to note we have elderly parents at home that need a little extra time to respond to a courier. We also live a in time where security issues arise from time to time, particularly in urban areas.Theft can be a problem at any time but when deliveries are left unattended for any length of time, it's a red wragg to a bull! I get that drivers are generally in a rush to get to the next delivery and are human, but these days there's a  noticeable trend for couriers to often ignore instructions to wait until someone answers the door,drop the item on the doorstep and move on. One customer support person informed me that these are called ""unattended deliveries"" Genius.Reporting this to their Deliveries and Logistics department turned out to be a fruitless exercise (so please save yourself the time and hope). Despite assurances to look into the problem, the problem kept reoccurring, and bizarrely logistics kept on giving the same assurances. Its eternal loop!They may well investigate the problem, whilst it continues to happen but will claim, due to GDPR and to protect the drivers identity claimants are not allowed to know the outcome of the investigation in any way. Utter garbage.So you will never know if the problem has even been addressed and since it keeps happening, whatever efforts they may or may not of made, ultimately amount to nothing. I'm sure you can spot the loophole here..I'm sure they are lovely people doing their best, but I have cancelled my prime membership and saved 9 pounds a month for a similar service - they will not offer any other resolution and, as a manager told me after 3 hours of speaking to customer support,  ""we cannot change our policy and there's nothing more we can do"" Avoid this happening to you because they are not serious about your security.",2024,08,August,2024,4.0,1.0,low

In fact, all I have ever asked for is my product to be delivered and give me a real date that I can expect delivery when promised. They will then tell you they are issuing a refund because the system gives them no other option and when the item arrives you can keep it.  All the while insisting it will be delivered.

I either did not receive items delivered when they were supposed to be delivered, or I did not receive the item at all. My packages are addressed to a private mail center that closes at a certain time. I indicated the business hours on the delivery instructions...which apparently are not read. I have received notifications of attempted deliveries...AFTER the business closed. I have had to call Amazon more times during the last 3 months, than I have since I have been a Prime member. Whatever changes that Amazon made regarding their delivery service are definitely not positive changes, at least not for the customers. Lately, for me anyway, Amazon's delivery service has definitely been less than favorable!This review was written July, 2024.",2024,07,July,2024,1.0,1.0,low
628,GB,Disappointing Delivery Experience with…,"Disappointing Delivery Experience with Amazon - Delayed and UnresolvedI am writing to express my disappointment with Amazon's delivery service. My recent order, which was guaranteed for delivery by 1 PM today, has now been delayed by up to four days. This is not the first time I have experienced such issues, and it is becoming increasingly frustrating.Key Issues:Missed Guaranteed Delivery: The 1 PM delivery guarantee was not met, causing significant inconvenience.Extended Delay: The delivery is now expected to be up to four days late, which is unacceptable.No Cancellation Option: There is no option to cancel the order until it is delivered, which is very off-putting.No Refund for Delivery Fees: Despite paying extra for the guaranteed 1 PM delivery, there is no option for a refund of these charges.Impact:These repeated delays and the lack of effective resolution options have severely impacted my trust in Amazon's service. The inability to cancel or receive a refund for the delivery fees adds to the frustration.Decision:Due to these ongoing issues, I have decided to cancel my Amazon subscription. The repeated failures in delivery and poor handling of these situations have led me to seek more reliable alternatives.Overall, this experience has been extremely disappointing, and I hope Amazon takes steps to improve its delivery services and customer support.But looking at all the previous reviews they never seem to read any of them so they will never learn how to improve.Sincerely,",2024,07,July,2024,18.0,2.0,low

630,GB,Delivery shocking,"Been with Amazon as a Prime member for years but actually leaving due to there delayed deliveries. Going away on holiday and ordered important items, but driver lied and got notification that they had attempted delivery…. I was in the house with front door open…. We have a smart doorbell…. No one came. I called to let Amazon know, and they assured me that my second delivery would arrive with no issues (as that was the important one). I kept checking notifications, and it said my delivery was next…. That was at 5pm- was checking the app the the driver went past and it said I was getting it in a few drops, then finally at 9:50pn the driver headed to the motorway and back to depo. Called Amazon and they apologised, and said it would be delivered in the morning,- the next day I have a message saying it won’t be delivered for another day- when I’m away!!!  They are a joke. Need to change delivery companies- as the ones they have now just not doing the job. ",2024,07,July,2024,4.0,1.0,low
631,US,Amazon has gone from a phenomenal…,Amazon has gone from a phenomenal company to a horrible company in  just a couple of months. Returns used to be seamless and now they are a nightmare. Their customer service has become arrogant and will hang up on you when you get frustrated and upset with them. Returns are an absolute nightmare. If it’s from a third-party seller you can’t take it to Staples  you have to take it to UPS. The UPS store is 25 minutes from me! Several months ago I had a problem with a wicker chair from a third-party seller. It was a complete nightmare… the seller canceled the order and I ordered somewhere else and then they delivered the chair anyway..it was an absolute nightmare trying to get it back to the seller UPS refused to pick it up and kept asking me for a tracking number and I said I don’t have the tracking number you give me the tracking number  it’s here it’s ready to be picked up and they just refused to pick it up. Amazon‘s A-Z guarantee is an absolute joke they don’t stand behind it. I probably spend five hours of my time on this chair and trying to return it. Eventually I charged it back on my bank credit card. My bank came down on my side. If all of that isn’t bad enough now they are requiring signatures and codes in order to deliver your packages. How can someone give a signature if they are at work so your package goes back-and-forth eventually you don’t get it at all and then you can try re-ordering it and hope that you’re home when they come by for your signature. I ordered items for my brother and they sent the code to me by the time I got it to my brother it was too late the driver had already been there they tried again to deliver and he wasn’t there and eventually all the items went back to amazon. Who in the world is running this company? I understand they arehaving problems with stolen packages but the solution is that the customer doesn’t get their package at all!!! so is it worst if its stolen or to have amazon take it back because they’re not able to get your signature or some code in order to leave your package.?  I don’t know if they’ve been taken over by new management but I have never seen such a terribly run company and how that can happen in a few short months is just beyond me.,2024,07,July,2024,11.0,1.0,low
632,US,Just sick right now.,I have been shopping on amazon for years. I have spent thousands.  I have also been a big advocate for support brick and mortar stores even if you have to pay a lil more because stores like amazon will easily take consumers for granted. Use you to get there then work against you severely. Here is one such case. This is not the first mind you but years ago when I had a similar case they did help resolve it.So I put this review here because amazon is nortorious for not allowing your reviews against their best sellers or them to see the light of day.  There is zero reason why a place like amazon CANNOT protect your purchases for a extended period of time beyond 30 to 60 days..after 30 days because the items were small I just ignore bad items..take the hit..but on big ones this is bad.I purchased a solar generator for a VERY good price I knew would not come around again if I passed up that deal so I purchased it...it was such a great deal that I was going to purchase two but when I went back it was the last one and discontinued. Ok no biggie.  I didnt need to use it then. But knew in tbe near future I would with what I have been dealing with.So I got it nov. 11 of 2023. I just opened it to set it up last week of june 2024 when to my dismay the thing did not work at all...ony the charging part..no lights..no power receptacles worked nothing. I had video taped the whole unboxing because I was going to start uploading randon things to you tube.So I contacted Amazon...they said they contacted the seller successfully and I should hear from them within 48 hrs. Ok...nothing..two weeks so far nothing..so finally I called back amazon because they said if I didnt hear back and no resolution call them back so I did..ONLY for them to say there is nothing they can do..then I pressed a lil to say look this is a total loss I just opened it..the item was on sale at real low price you wouldnt find else where for a 1100 watt solar generator for 300 bucks...so the rep put me on hold and finally came back and said give VB direct 24 to 48 hrs to respond..so what it seems like if they dont respond I am sol.This is pretty bad I cannot imagine the yearly loss to customers because of Amzon policy. 30 days goes by in a flash especially with how our lives are consumed with various things. Its not unheard of for people to buy something they know they could later because they found it at a price they know just never happens or wont when they will need it.So what..only buy something you plan on using immediately? While nothing I am sure will come of this and this will be a 300.00 loss to me.There is no reason Amazon cannot provide solid purchase protection for people purchasing from their site. It a 30 day return policy stated...but they MAY.. with some persistance provide help up to 60 days.. not listed in their policy but a internal manegerial understanding from how it was conveyed..and that leniency is provided based soley on circumstance.Amazon could easily recover losses through insurance if not from the vendor on items solidly proven to have just been accessed by the buyer..and rightfully yes..only with solid proof like I have.. Add to policy for sellers that they are atleast responible for damaged item up to 190 days. And if the seller have stopped selling on Amazon before that time is up then selectively with solid proof from the buyer the item was just opened months after purchase.  Then insurance claim and favors the buyer.The buyer is what makes all company that provides a platform for sale of items or actually sell items...so this was a massive loss to me because of Amzon policy. ,2024,07,July,2024,3.0,1.0,low

Customer service is almost always great and they're not difficult to deal with for returns and refunds at all. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth for amazon.com where my wife ordered a single book which arrived damaged.At first, everything seemed to be dealt with smoothly. Customer service assured my wife that a replacement book would be sent free of charge and the original item did not need to be returned (sensible, given the costly logistics involved for them with international shipping). The replacement book arrived and was in the condition you would expect a new book to be.Fast forward about 3 weeks... I check my bank balance for no reason in particular and I see a charge from amazon.com. Now, I haven't ordered from Amazon.com ever in my life, but I knew my wife had and asked if she had ordered something again and accidentally selected the wrong card (my card, which is linked as a ""household"" in our account settings).It turns out, no, she had not ordered anything from Amazon.com but, upon contacting their customer service, I was informed that they had charged MY bank account rather than the account used for the original order to claw back money for failing to return an item ---> an item THEY ASSURED US did not need to be returned!Then the circus really began as they forced us into the weirdest game of whack-a-mole I've ever encountered... They couldn't talk to me about taking money out of my account because the order was in my wife's account....And then told her they couldn't talk to her about money coming out of my account because it was not in her name... Then they insisted we call a ""toll free number"" IN THE BLOODY USA (which is never going to be toll free when calling from the UK!!) and finally...after about 3-4 hours of both of us pushing and pushing and telling them there was no way we were getting on the phone because the cost of the phone call would be greater than the refund value, I FINALLY got confirmation that the refund would be issued.Then, I receive an email (sent twice...) stating that the refund would be ""issued in 3-5"", not days not weeks not hours, just ""in 3-5""...But I figure I'll wait and see... And what do you know? 17 days later... No refund! So now, I get to start the circus all over again because it has become a matter of principle at this point. This is no longer about $27 and change.

Lawrence then said in his culture people don’t knock on the door which actually has nothing to do with the delivery whatsoever and sounds unprofessional and quite stupid.

Thereafter they told me it would arrive the next day- I contacted them several time to see when it was coming and cancelled all my plans waiting for this to come. It didn’t turn after being told it would arrive before 10pm. I was then told it should come the next day and they’d try to prioritise it for the morning delivery. I called up again several times and no one could say when it was coming. They refused to send it to another address 5 minutes down the road. They refused to request it comes late that day so I can be in. They couldn’t tell me a time slot. They just expect you to be in between 9am- 10pm waiting for a parcel that may arrive. They said they’d give me £5 compensation (which I think isn’t enough anyway). I never received it. The supervisor couldn’t help at all and hung up the phone during our conversation which is extremely unprofessional. I cannot keep calling them and wasting anymore time for this very expensive parcel to hopefully arrive. I’m just shocked that Amazon are doing nothing to help the matter.

They continued to repeat that I had breached their agreement (never giving any more details), and they told me that all my following e-mails wouldn't be answered and that my account""s"" would remain closed.

712,US,"Amazon was great, but not a great value anymore","I started using Amazon back in the 1990s as a graduate student. I purchased my textbooks there as it was cheaper than the university bookstore and tax free. Fast forward to 2008 when Amazon asked me to try prime for free. I did. And didn't realize they charged me $79 for the membership. I decided to keep it because products were cheaper than at on-ground stores, no taxes and free shipping. Then in 2012 China clamped down on counterfeit producers and stopped them from selling product in China. In 2012 Amazon opened the door to these Chinese sellers and Amazon became flooded with a bunch of junk products. The price of prime kept rising, but I kept it because of Prime video and 2-day delivery. When I became sick I relied on Amazon more. Now Amazon is expensive. They have moved lots of shows to Freevee, which I don't watch because I don't do ad TV. And to add insult to injury this year, 2024, they started adding ads to Prime Video and demanding an extra $3/month to remove the ads, citing all of the other services they added to Prime. I don't use those other services, so it is bloatware to me. Stuff isn't being delivered in 2 days anymore. And there have been times when products were lost in their shipping facilities and not delivered. You call Amazon and they outsource their customer service overseas, these people have no way to contact the drivers. This is rubbish. The seller ALWAYS has contact with shipping! Paying extra for same-day delivery doesn't guarantee it will be delivered same-day. Amazon stopped packing cushioning in boxes so I've received items damaged. I've received spoiled food items. I was horrified to learn the tea I was drinking expired months before. Once they shipped me pet food meant to be sold in Mexico. So, even though you purchase from one seller they ship the product that is closer to your domicile, which might not be the same quality. Prices aren't cheaper than the on-ground store anymore, sometimes it is higher. Taxes are included too. So there is no value to having Amazon anymore. I even submitted my SSN & 1099 to sell t-shirts on Amazon. They stopped adding people to the program that didn't have a huge social media following. But refused to delete my information from their database. Lastly, I purchased a product that was defective, a sports watch. I wanted to exchange it. The watch cost hundreds of dollars. The customer service rep wanted to offer me $25 for it. I demanded a supervisor and the US support team processed the exchange. When Hurricane Beryl was bearing down on Houston TX, I ordered the Midland NOAA radio bundle so I could be notified of tornados and floods should I lose power. My home was hit by a tornado in May 2024, so the threat was real. I paid extra for same day delivery. Amazon split the bundle with one part being delivered in a week and the other same-day, except they never delivered it and promised to deliver it AFTER the hurricane. I called and spoke to three reps. One had a fake barking dog sound and you couldn't hear a word she said. After 30 minutes she just told me to call the number I called to get her.

Today's debacle - I bought a bathroom vanity with cabinet and top and the top is chipped along with a crack starting at the chip.  I submitted refund paperwork, they offered an additional $208 discount (on $902 vanity) but it's in an obvious location and this just doesn't work for me.  So I scheduled pickup, I had to buy a banding kit so I could package it properly (another $80), and took the day off from work.  The pickup time was scheduled for 12:00 - 8:00.  At 3:30(ish) a rented truck pulled up in front of my house and I thought - they're here!  I waited for them to come to the door as I was on the computer - but much to my surprise they put the truck in reverse and drove off.  Amazon then informed me that the company rejected the delivery because they couldn't contact me.  Complete and utter BS.  I was sitting in the house with an open window and could see the driver.  Nobody called, nobody came to the door, and the ""Pickup failed: Carrier rejected your return"" just illustrates how crappy Amazon service is becoming.  Seriously - they must think people are stupid and have unlimited time on their hands.  Now they want to reschedule (another day off work - another lost PTO day (± $550) and for what?  Drivers that are too damned lazy to do their job??

Items have been left in full view of a public footpath just 3 feet away and then reported as 'handed to resident' when they clearly haven't; I've even had a dinner-service (yes a dinner service) thrown over my gate to be picked up in several hundred pieces.The latest one is a wet and dry hoover shown as delivered when no attempt to deliver was made for which there is video evidence; reported the same day and then told by a (ro)bot on chat 'we're sorry, sometimes things are marked as delivered up to 48 hours before they actually are' - this is a barefaced LIE : items cannot be marked delivered until the bar-codes are scanned by the driver, which they do at the door. This was a box (from the replacement) about 1ft cubed weighing 7.5Kg that it seems was somehow misplaced. It has no outer packaging other than the manufacturers box so its quite obvious what it is and I guess may have been nabbed by the driver for a relative or for E-bay. Nevertheless the message from the (ro)bot says 'please give us 48 hours and then chase us up again.' This is expressly designed to put off very busy people such that they just accept very expensive and completely obvious items going missing and pay for them anyway.I however, didn't give up and reported again on Friday and was told a replacement would be with me by Sunday - which it was; together with an e-mail telling me that if I failed to return the original by Monday, I would be charged on my credit card for it....This is the 'original' that was never received - hence my asking for a replacement!I finally managed to speak to a human being this morning and when I questioned the absurdity of this - he told me 'unfortunately it's just how the system works.'

I double checked the customs import duties, was assured it was correct, paid up front, was promised delivery by 16 July 2024 and guess what?... Yesterday I was informed that my LapTop was returned to sender because the tax/duties was incorrect. Thank you Amazon, I was really looking forward to receiving my product and now you will, undoubtedly, have me jumping through obstacles as you hang on to my money and refund in a few months on the premise that you have administrative checks. Shame on you for treating customers this way. Are you going to reimburse me for my loss of % on my bank account, bank charges, inconveince? No way as half the time you use stupid AI.  I tried to phone you in accordance with your helpline and got a message saying press 150 when I did it disconnected me. I repeated this 3 times with the same result. So much for your AI; it's rubbish at the expense of a human being losing their job, income and prospects. Dear Readers, my experience is horrible and causes loss and inconvenience. I would be very cautious in ordering anything expensive which includes import duties / taxes as Amazon's systems are lacking and I will now have lots of hassles and waiting for my refund.It's not  fair as when you order they demand split second payment, but when things go wrong, I am treated like I am at the back of a long queue and I wish I could give a zero star rating.J N STACHIW, SOLICITOR.27 July. This is an update. As predicted, Amazon wrote to me saying wait until 17 August and then contact them again! I presume this was an automated email as a subsequent and human email confirmed the parcel was being returned and payment would be made 5 days later. I asked if I would receive any compensation for loss of bank interest etc and this has been ignored. The conclusion here is that Amazon are now so big that they no longer have to worry about customer care as they did when they started. Commercially they can cut costs by forgetting about customer care and focusing on increasing profits. 20 August 2024Well I finally got my refund after a 6 week delay. This is horrendous as their policy is simply to make customers wait before they give a refund. I asked for compensation for my lost bank charges and their policy is to never compensate.

803,US,Don't buy Amazon gift cards from a third-party. Amazon will steal your money and close your account. That's what they did to me...,"I have been a long time Amazon customer. For years I have used Amazon and their services and have had no problems with the company. Recently I started buying Amazon gift cards to accumulate points on my credit cards. Also at times I was able to buy gift cards for a better deal than using my Amazon credit card which only offers 5% cashback on Amazon purchases.Amazon canceled some of my orders and said that my amazon.com gift cards are in violation of their gift card ""terms and conditions"". I called into Amazon and provided documentation showing that these gift cards were purchased legitimately from a third-party. I also showed credit card receipts to Amazon showing that I purchased these gift cards. In going through their terms and conditions I violated none of them. Also the customer service representatives that I spoke with admitted that this was flagged mistakenly as fraud because I purchased many gift cards and it was not my fault. They restored access to my account and credited the gift cards in question to my account.After this incident I thought that everything was fine. As usual I placed more orders on Amazon and they flagged four of my gift cards totaling $423. They accused me of these gift cards being fraudulent which they were not and closed my account. I provided Amazon with screenshots of gift card purchases and my credit card statement showing these gift cards were purchased legitimately but this just fell on deaf ears. Amazon claimed that I was in violation of their “conditions of use”. I went through their conditions of use multiple times and could not find any violation I was guilty of. I asked specifically what violation I was guilty of and never got a response.Let me reiterate that I have done nothing wrong except buy gift cards from someone other than Amazon. I provided documentation proving my innocence but this did not matter. Being a long time and loyal Amazon customer this really was upsetting. Amazon stole $423 in gift cards from me that I purchased legitimately, canceled my membership, and there is nothing that I can do about it. Any proof that I sent to Amazon was completely ignored. Unfortunately I thought Amazon was a better company than this but it seems that they are just a huge organization that really doesn't care about their customers and will actually steal their hard earned money.This being said be very careful about purchasing Amazon gift cards from a third-party because Amazon may steal your money and close your account where you will have no repercussions whatsoever.

I called Blink they tell me to call Amazon , this went back and forth 4 times until I called my bank. The info on the charge had Amazon contact so it was definitely them, ended up canceling all my cards and got new ones. Called Amazon back again with info saying it was Amazon, they tell after 6 phone calls that they see the charge this time. They say either friends or family have my card info witch is impossible,  they only place that had my card I fo was Amazon. They would not tell me who or what account used my card. That's when I decided to erase all my info on Amazon and never use them again. ",2024,07,July,2024,3.0,1.0,low

And they take FOREVER to credit your form of payment if you cancel an order. Yet, they take your money right away. They SAY they only charge your account when they actually ship your item, but that's a blatant lie! They USED to not charge right away, but now they do. Like somebody else said on here: ""they are turning into another Temu."" I cannot agree more. I'm sticking with eBay, Etsy, and other sites that actually care about their customers, and not how fast their CEO can get on another rocket 🚀 headed for outer space. Seriously.

823,US,Amazon delivery trucks refuse to park on the street.,"I too have had problems with Amazon deliveries at 10:00PM.  I repeatedly told them no deliveries after dark but the request is routinely ignored.  In addition to that their drivers insist on driving into my driveway and up to my gargage instead of parking on the street and walking up to the front door or garage door.  The driveway is narrow and there is insufficient room to turn their vehicles around to drive out in forward gear.  They must drive out in reverse, which many cannot do.  Consequently they have damaged my property by driving off the driveway and/or driving into the traffic cones and reflectors that I have placed along the driveway.  I more recently got a block to place at the end of the driveway to prevent them from driving in.  In response they began to leave packages at the driveway block which is about 8' from the street.  Packages have gotten wet and been snowed upon and hidden from view only to find damaged contents the next AM.   UPS and FedEx drivers are instructed NOT to drive into the customer's driveway and to park on the street.  I have no idea why Amazon cannot do the same. ",2024,07,July,2023,28.0,1.0,low

She has been very rude towards me from the begging of the call when i asked her why is she rude she never answered when i asked her to connect to the superior she gave a reply which was not easy to belive she said no superior available and she cannot connect my call again when i asked why is she so rude she simply said as the customer is not having any further concerns iam going to disconnect the call this is what she said thrice and straight away she disconnected my call. if you guys are delivering good products no one has free time to request for return or refund i have been wasting my time trying to contact customer service placing return request asking for refund which did nt happen untill now.

Forget Prime for next day delivery that is also a has been that we pay for. An increased volume of subpar third party products with Zero warranty from both Amazon and the seller after thirty days. Proving that Amazon has approved the seller and the 30 day return window making Amazon an accessory to alleged fraud. All it says to the Amazon customer is buyer beware. Amazon customer service especially in situations like reporting a non functioning product a day after the 30 day window is closed is an hour long run around pre designed to run your through endless hoops without a resolution through attrition to get you off their backs and keep your money.

929,US,Will not honor return policy. Rude customer service,"Love Amazon for making shopping convenient, but they  play dumb knowing they aren't honoring their own policies.   Especially when things often arrive defective or damaged. They are not honoring their return policy and actually require that I call Amazon customer service for my returns over the last 2 years.  Plus, one day I subscribed to a free 7 day trial on Amazon prime and it automatically charged me and made it impossible for me to cancel online.  It makes sense why the FTC is currently suing Amazon for making it difficult for people to cancel Amazon Prime.  It seems like they are making it difficult to process returns or subscriptions intentionally.  When I noticed my return shipping date was coming up and I still did not have a return shipping label I contacted Amazon.  Their customer support told me they were going to handle it.  Then they transferred me to another department to process the credit - and the other rep got very abrasive and said I was outside my return date and made it clear he is hanging up on me.  I remained polite and told him that online it says I still have time to return. He told me the app was wrong and he was hanging up.  Rude!  I filed a complaint with the FTC and the BBB because they should be investigated.   They should also train their customer service reps on how to speak to people.  When I wrote a review on Amazon about the interaction - of course it says Amazon has several days to review my review prior to posting. I noticed all of my previous reviews were not on amazon!!  They obviously screen reviews and block them. None of my reviews have curse words or links etc.  Just honest feedback. It can be hit or miss since things do get damaged in delivery, items can be defective, etc. I totally understand sometimes things happen.  Customers should not be penalized for these issues and customer service should be assisting instead of the unprofessional behavior and being hung up on intentionally.  Instead of aggressively defending bad business practices they could just honor their own policies. I shop online for the convenience, but if they will not honor their return policy or if I'm going to be yelled at and hung up on when I have to take time out of MY day to call them every time I need to return one of their defective items I will definitely try to limit purchasing items on Amazon.

Lastly, they increasingly don't show the negative reviews about products (likely to favor the selling of the merchandise).

Just very poor customer service.......I usually don't complain or call to make a report but this was really rude and disrespectful so I did and got the same treatment so I suggest not using this dumbass company.....,2024,07,July,2024,1.0,1.0,low

Deliveries are horrendous just throwing things in to the garden and they get wet when it rains. they state 'handed to resident' when there is no one in and when you offer Cctv evidence Amazon are not interested. Amazon are just to big now, we little people are the ones who just give them money, if they losses a few of us what the hell, who cares, clearly Amazon do not, and we are only buying a quick delivery convenience because if you look elsewhere most of the time you can always find it cheaper but it takes a little while longer, so in future we will ONLY be using Amazon as a 'MUST' have tomorrow option from now on and started that yesterday.

They agreed to refund my order cheerfully and apologized for the inconvenience. I checked my credit card statement to make sure they gave me a full refund and they shorted me almost $17.00 and did not give a full refund. I contacted them again and advised them that they did not give me a full refund. They apologized again and said they would give a full refund. I checked my credit card again and discovered that they did the same thing again, they only gave me a partial refund. I didn't contact them again and I have not placed an order since. Amazon made me wait over 2 weeks for the package, they shorted me on the refund twice. I am posting this review to warn people that amazon is doing this to customers.

984,US,3rd Party Purchaser,"I recently purchased an item from a third-party seller on Amazon, which was advertised with a 30-day return guarantee. However, my attempt to return the item has been an incredibly frustrating experience. The third-party seller refused to provide a return slip, leaving me at a loss for how to proceed.In an effort to resolve the issue, I reached out to Amazon customer service five times via chat and phone. During each interaction, I was assured that I would receive a refund within 48-72 hours. Unfortunately, these promises never materialized. On my final attempt to contact Amazon, I was shocked to learn that they were unsure why I had been repeatedly told I would receive a refund, as the item apparently cannot be returned. When I pointed out the 30-day return guarantee clearly stated on the website, I was told this information was incorrect.This experience has left me feeling misled and disappointed. As a Prime member, I expected better support in resolving this issue. Instead, I've wasted countless hours trying to address the problem, only to be told that Amazon cannot assist further. I'm now left with an unwanted product and over $300 out of pocket.This situation raises serious concerns about Amazon's policies regarding third-party sellers and their commitment to customer satisfaction. Why would Amazon allow third-party businesses on their platform if they cannot comply with Amazon's stated policies? Moreover, why isn't Amazon willing to work with customers and sellers to resolve disputes fairly? This system seems to open up opportunities for third-party sellers to potentially scam Amazon purchasers.I would appreciate if Amazon could clarify their policies regarding third-party sellers and returns, improve their customer service to provide accurate information, and implement better measures to ensure third-party sellers comply with Amazon's policies. This experience has significantly diminished my trust in Amazon's marketplace and their commitment to customer satisfaction.",2024,07,April,2024,5.0,1.0,low

They state that if you order goods totalling 35.00 or more, your order is eligible for free delivery. I ordered some essential oils from the same seller. I checked each order to verify that it was eligible for free delivery. When I proceeded to checkout, I skipped Prime, and I was still being charged 4.99 for postage. This is because Amazon had a bottle of the essential oils ticked for premium delivery to arrive tomorrow, which I did not tick.  Customer services were useless as I was told that 3 of the oils were coming directly from a 3rd party seller and not Amazon. This is despite ordering all of the oils from the same seller and all of them being eligible for free delivery. I removed the oil that had the premium delivery cost added to it and attempted to check out. However, a different oil came up for next day delivery. This happened 3 times with the oils that were previously listed for free delivery, now showing a premium delivery cost. There was no option to untick the premium delivery cost as Amazon automatically applies this to your order.This breaches advertising and trading standards and is clearly fraudulent. The customer service adviser stated that the reason for this was that information in baskets changed as orders were updated, and the seller would change the information to reflect what was in stock.  I guess she thought I imagined it all and that I did not know what I was talking about. I will be reporting Amazon to the requisite body as this does need investigating.  It is such a long and frustrating process and a total waste of time. With this big online fraudster.  Your track record is disgusting as you are just interested in profits over people.

I contacted Amazon to get a return label and when I carried the shed that weigh 30 kg plus to the post office they told me that the postage was not covered, I contacted Amazon. They assured me they would get back to the seller who would contact me within two days to arrange return of the goods. Now six weeks later, I am being told by Amazon that The order was placed under a different email address and they can only deal with that person. I have pointed out to them that there must be 100 orders before and since that order all placed under the same email address the same delivery address using the same card. I have spent over 50 hours trying to get my money back I’ve been told on two occasions that they would force the third-party to return my money within seven days which hasn’t happened. I have wrote three letters to their managing director and finally I had an answer over the phone this evening.. The person on the phone has given me absolute no confidence of me getting my money back. He’s saying it can’t be looked at under GDPR The order was placed under a different email address and I’m asking him how that’s happened when all the other orders are showing placed under the right email address. I’ve also asked him when when I applied to return the goods why it came out off my orders on the app making it very difficult for me to take the matter up with their customer services. I am also very concerned that the third-party that I placed my order with on the Amazon website have ceased trading and why Amazon allowing companies that do not trade to sell on their website. The guy on the telephone could not answer that question said he would report it, but I would hear nothing back as it would stay an internal matter. this is clearly not good enough and they as they are not protecting their customers.",2024,06,May,2024,56.0,1.0,low

I have been robbed basically and amazon do not care. I won't get anything back. I'm going to get legal advice. This is disgusting service.  The delivery and customer service is abysmal.

The issue is some of the products not matching the description - I do think that Amazon could provide a better feedback service and supplier to get regular bad reviews blocked from selling such products or even the platform - perhaps Trustpilot should team up with Amazon for this as you have the platform for reviews?Overall, I am very happy with Amazon, I have been a Prime Customer for over 10 years and will continue to be so - there is more they get right than they don't, and any company with such a diverse range is going to have hiccups from time to time.

Why show me shoes of size 10 if I am looking for size 13? It’s such a waste of time. I don’t buy there, only on eBay, where there’s an optimistic atmosphere and sellers can leave feedback for buyers in return. Sellers don’t pay for clicks to show their products in search but pay a percentage from the sold price. eBay shows me only the products matching my search criteria. Other marketplaces such as Walmart, Target, etc. are much better too, with fast and free shipping as well.I am not going to pay for this Prime subscription—I am fine with longer shipping.

1086,US, Amazon's Decline ,I  have used Amazon for just about everything. From pet treats to my clothing. The products have been good the prices competitive. But as many large companies once they secure their customers their policies change. Now their return polices have deteriorated. I can no longer have the item picked up by the amazon courier but must find a drop off center or post office and pay the postage many times to China to return the item. IT is a huge hazzel and I DO NOT RECOMMEND USING AMAZON ANY MORE. IT is not the same company. As a writer I have also found the KDP department is very unsupportive to authors and their pay out methods are nothing like they used to be.  ,2024,06,June,2024,9.0,1.0,low

Canon said the number of the printer I gave them was not a valid number and I told them that is what is stamped on the front of the printer.  They asked where it was purchased and I told them Amazon.  Canon told me Amazon sent me a Canadian product and therefore the warranty is not valid in the US.  They told me my only recourse was to call Amazon.Amazon did not want to do anything about it since it was after the 30 day return period.  After a rather heated discussion with them about deceptive selling practices they did agree to refund after I return the item.  I got an email from them with shipping instructions and an estimated refund which was 20% less (for a restocking fee).  Another discussion followed and I have to call them after they receive the return for the 20% to be refunded.  They also did not want to refund me for 2 unused ink cartridges I had ordered but they finally agreed after I expressed my opinion on that.  So, after 1 hour and 5 minutes on the phone with Amazon today I get to call them back again for the 20%.Tip of the day:  Don't order electronics from Amazon.",2024,06,June,2024,1.0,1.0,low

I contacted Amazon again on Friday and was transferred to a so called manager who was extremely patronising and told me to look at my messages on the 15th June and I would see the label. I explained that it was there but it instructs me to print it but he assured me this would be ok and I stupidly took his word for it, as I got sick of him saying 'as I have already told you' and as he then cut me of and didn't have the decency to call me back, so I took this fairly heavy parcel, on foot to the nearest Hermes shop and they wouldn't accept it because it was a print only label and they didn't have a printer, so by this time, I was in tears at the thought of walking home with it, having wasted 1.5hrs.

1156,GB,Amazon don't have a Complaint team and if they do nobody knows where ,"There is so much wrong with the way Amazon deals with their customers and my experience with the company in the last 10 months, that it is pretty impossible to sum it up in a review. However given the awful experience and their ongoing failure to resolve the issues I feel others who may not have used this platform often or recently should know exactly what they might face if anything goes wrong. My account suddenly appeared to be frozen with the only option to make digital orders -very clever as I subscribe to Kindle- this issue first happened in May 24 which was frustrating as my daughter did not to receive her birthday present which I ordered in plenty of time. Eventually I was told the possible reasons and was passed on to FOUR different people over the space of three hours. I'll refrain from going through all the incompetence I experienced but I'll sum it up by saying it's now 7.15 and today at 3pm I was assured my order had been processed and would be delivered tomorrow, after speaking to 3 people and a manager I'm none the wiser and once again the items I urgently need won't be here! But of course payment has been taken and nobody has advised me not to place a new order, on the contrary I am told I'm a valued loyal customer and there's no reason for me to cancel an Amazon account that I can't access!!! Oh and apparently Complaints and Escalations team doesn't exist despite the email I've received from them and although I am visually impaired the only way to communicate is by email!!!

I ordered an item on Saturday afternoon specifically because it stated the item would arrive the next day on Sunday. The item did arrive the next day, albeit a little late. But the main problem was the item I had ordered did not work. I set up a return and Royal Mail collected the damaged item to be returned. Whilst I waited for the refund, I reordered another item, the same as what I had ordered on the Saturday, but a different brand. This was due to be delivered on Tuesday. The item I had ordered required very specific batteries to operate, so I added those to the same order to ensure I'd be able to use my item when it finally arrives on Tuesday. The item did arrive, albeit a little late again, on Tuesday as stated. However, for some reason the batteries are coming separate. Amazon did say these batteries would arrive on the same day, Tuesday, by 10pm. However, it's past 10pm and there is no sign of them. Item still waiting to be dispatched according to the app, but still on track to arrive today by 10pm? It's Tuesday night and I'm still without the item I originally ordered to get on Sunday.

I hoped to then be able to sell the brand-new replacement for a decent amount and buy a better keyboard, but Amazon just offered a full refund, which I happily accepted.I've had returns on close to ten orders, some of which have been swiftly closed with ""refund issued, no need to return the item,"" the others returned with a prepaid parcel slip that just needs to be printed and stuck on the box, and once they've received the item back, a refund has been issued.Once I bought twelve bottles of baby oil (enough to get free shipping), and it was delivered damaged with three bottles having escaped through a hole. I called the local carrier and was put in queue as number 90-something. While waiting I checked the Amazon website and discovered the option to have Amazon call you up. I activated it and was immediately called on my phone by an employee who promptly refunded me money for the three missing bottles, no questions asked. The local carrier called me back two hours later.This last refund was set in motion by the friendliest German supporter who laughed with me at my broken German and did his best to follow my better English.If there's one negative, it's that the search function on their own website is basically useless, so I have to use Google with ""site:amazon.de"" added to the query instead.I see many negative reviews based on having been fooled by refund scammers, fake websites, or forgetting your password and blaming Amazon, hating on Bezos (which I agree with), or some other random own-fault issue.I've spent at least 10k € over a decade and NEVER had a bad experience with them.People, if someone randomly calls you up and say they're from Amazon (or any other business), hang up the phone and block that number.

My review has been denied with an email from Amazon telling me that my review could not focus on seller, delivery, packaging, pricing, or availability. Wait, what? Isn't it one of these items that we are typically reviewing when we provide a review?I ordered 2 $100 VISA cards, requested next day delivery. Included in the same order were three other items. I was excited when I received a delivery notice for the next day AM. At my doorstep was a typical sealed box and a sealed envelope. The three items were in the box. The sealed enveloped, when opened, contained nothing. Most importantly, it did not contain the two cards. I immediately called Amazon customer service (now clearly offshored - if you've experienced Amazon customer service you will understand) and was told that because it was within 24 hours of the order, I would have to call back the next day. I requested an email, which I received. I called back the next day after spending over 2 hours on the phone, I was finally escalated to a Manager. I was told that cards had already been used, that my situation would be escalated to ""card services"" and I would get a call back within 24-48 hours. I requested an email, which I received. Otherwise, crickets, I never received a call from Amazon ""card services.""I then called the distributor of the card (Sunrise Banks), who advised me that no only had the cards been registered to someone NOT in my name, also that they had been used for an online purchase. They took down my information, sent me an email, asked for proof of purchase of the cards, which I sent to them. And, in that same email advised me that I would hear back from them within 24 hours. Again, crickets. I decided my only course of action was to file a dispute with the credit card company I used for this purchase. They have reached out to Amazon, and in reply I received a completely nonsensical, I kid you not, email from Amazon telling me that I should have called their customer service. The email went on to ask me for a credit card number against which they can charge the costs of my original purchase. It made zero sense.Where in the world did customer service go for Amazon?

""This product arrived on time and was wonderful the first time that we ordered it. We decided to purchase another. The problem is that the zipper is broken and the fabric is torn. It makes the seat look used instead of brand new.UPDATE:Someone came over to pick up the item before I had a chance to check my email and/or the message left on Amazon website.  I have to work. The guy came to the door, said he could not wait, as his supervisor was with him. He was impatient, maybe stressed because of the supervisor and not exactly polite. (I'm glad he has a job and want him to continue to work, but customer service is a positive thing.)Baseline: He could not take the package as it was not ready. He left a slip and said he'd be back tomorrow. It has to be in the box that it came in.I am 67 years old. I remember when we could return items whether we had the box that we bought them in or not. We were still able to get our money back. I paid for it. It is damaged. I want my money. I don't care. They should be able to take it whether or not it is in the same package.Also, if does not fit. Ironically, because of the damage, ie the zipper does not work, I am able to fit small pieces into the opening left when it is unzipped. I was not able to fix the section with the wheels in the pox though. I had no one to help me at the time and had to pull the wheels off to be more versatile. It took almost tow hours. I could not wait for help, as I have to have it ready. I'm not sure when he will come. I was almost able to fit everything in properly, but the top is unable to close, as some parts stick out.I was finally able to read the massage on Amazon. I can drop it off if it is not picked up. I don't drive. That's one reason why I order online. I have to wait for someone to pick it up for me and I have a deadline to get it back.First, they received their money with no problem. I fulfilled my end of the bargain ASAP. Yet,  I had to wait for them to ship it at their convivence. Now, that i need my money back, through no fault of my own, I can't have it back ASAP, I again have to wait and follow their guidelines to have a refund. Needless guidelines, as returns were previously made whether they fit in the original box or not. I understand that I have to wait for shipments and my refund, but it has to fit in the box? For real? Provide bigger boxes.And, what if I had thrown the box away? I don't have space to keep original boxes.Secondly, I was unable to work during the time that I tried to package it. If we go to court, I want to be reimbursed for the time that I lost. My money was not damaged. Their product was.Thirdly, I have a deadline, I have to get it back ASAP. I will either have to carry this item via bus. It's heavy. or, take an Uber, which is expensive and I want to be reimbursed either way for cost of transportation and my time. I may be able to have one of my sons transport me on their day off and/or after work. It was convenient to have it picked up. I deserve it. They got my undamaged money on time.I wanted to have them replace the seat, which would have been easy for me. The guy could have brought one. It was their decision to return the whole chair. They should make sure that they get it and I get either my money or a exchange.UPDATE:I went back to read instructions on Amazon again. It did not specify that it needed the original box, but did say that it had to be securely packaged. It is, as far as I am concerned. It fits in the box, although it is not sealed and items stick out of it. He can take it to UPS, they will package it and send it back. They did it when I returned an item for Spectrum.

A month later they charged me for the refund, and i had not kept the UPS receipt after I received the refund. The last tine I have tried to call, a horrible customer service experience. First, there's an AI chatbot that misunderstands and then proceeds incorrectly. Then there’s the person you finally get to speak with, a person where English is clearly not their first language. Then they state you will be issued a refund. Then refund is not given, Then I respond to the email survey concerning the call that the refund has not been made. Then I get an email that there was an error and that the refund will be issued. Then, there is still no refund. These 2 incidents have cost me just over $20.

I then spoke to the person and said I am happy to keep the card but please just charge me the correct amount and refund the rest or replace item.  All was ok and yes sure from agent side only to wake up today and they state that only once item is returned a full refund will be issued?

I needed to apply a gift card balance to my Amazon account, but the online reply was that it was “invalid” though it has never been used.Since the online Customer service department suggested it would be best to “chat“ with a representative, I enter a summary of the problem I was having to make it easier for my customer service representative.After one hour of waiting for a representative to respond online, Aman Joined the chat and asked if there was anything he could do. Clearly he had not bothered to read my summary, so I copied all of the information and reposted it in my reply. After another 10 minutes, I asked Aman to escalate this conversation to his superiors as a complaint and ended the session that had wasted more than one hour of my time.I am sure that it comes as no surprised anyone but, Jeff Bezos and his Amazon crew seem to only care about taking easy money as there is absolutely no interest in providing any true “customer service.”",2024,06,June,2024,1.0,1.0,low

1378,GB,Legal Cooling Off period beig ignored trying to complicate matter & not give refund,"I have a legal right to cancel in the 14 days cooling off period under distance selling regulations. I cancelled the £620 purchase of an O2 SIM from a 3rd party seller when I found it did not work in my area - contrary to what their website says - but the seller would not cancel. I cancelled on the advice of O2 where, after several attempts to check the SIM activation over the phone with O2 who could not find or access it, I took it into an O2 store who advised me to cancel it as that SIM and Mobile Broadband does not work where I live. I had checked the coverage checker before I bought it but was told that was the anticipated coverage after the upgrade was rolled out, their internal map told a different story. I cancelled it there and then while I was in store. My only option is a wired connection which I have now bought. I then contacted Amazon.co.uk 8 days ago under the A-Z Guarantee thinking this was a crystal clear case of cancelling in the cooling off period. I cancelled in the cooling off period in writing. It is in Amazon messages. What is there to argue about. Give me my refund. But no. I find that they say the decision is 7 days. THEN, if you add any details or chase because it is a simple case, THEY RESTART THE 7-DAY CLOCK. We are now on day 8 and as I chased/added proof, it will now be a minimum of 15 days until a decision and I cant chase before as it will restart the clock. Why will it take 15 days to 'decide' whether I can have my £620 back when the service does not work and I cancelled in the cooling off period. Even when I put in the claim over the phone, it was not actually filed the first time. I am not sure if this is deliberate to get rid of the semi-serious claimants but after I did not get an email confirming my £620 refund, I called again and found it had never been filed. i was told not to worry the second time, but then got a huge email requiring me to report this as a theft to the police and it went on and on. It seems the claim that was filed was filed incorrectly on my behalf saying i had not received it, then someone at Amazon took the agent's  filing as the version to work from and out of the blue introduced that looking at my messages about cancelling in the cooling off period and the agents filing, the item must have been stolen, and then proceeded to design a prolonged and convoluted way forward which involved reporting to the police and uploading the reports and it went on and on. This is just to delay the inevitable - whether I have to take Amazon or the seller to court as it was Amazon I found and used the seller from, and Amazon's A-Z guarantee that gives you false commitment to safety of your purchase. They are ACTUALLY trying to get the seller to keep my £620 for providing something that does not work and something I cancelled in the cooling off period in writing through their system so they can see. The A-Z Guarantee is not actually a guarantee that your money is safe. This is causing me so much stress. My mother has just died and I cant even communicated about her funeral service without getting dressed and driving for miles to get to an area I can use the internet. I sent them proof I have bought into a full fibre wired connection now as that is the only thing that will work. Still no response. I want to upload a no internet screenshot I took from home but funnily enough, I cant. Do not trust the A-Z Guarantee. Youl could not have a more straightforward case than mine. The service provider themselves told me to cancel as it would not work, I am in the cooling off period, and here we are 8 days later with no expected decision for another week. It is so stressful not to be able to chase or ask without the clock resetting. It is very manipulative and not at ALL cusomer 'service'.",2024,05,May,2024,17.0,1.0,low

1398,US,Package not delivered as promised ,I had a delivery that was scheduled to arrive between 8 AM and 11 AM on memorial day. The package was also overnighted by the seller.I received a notification from Amazon that the driver was 10 stops away So I started to pay attention to the stops.Once the driver was three stops away. I stayed in my living room waiting for them to arrive. All of a sudden I receive a message from Amazon stating the package was undeliverable and my ring cam alerted me that someone was outside. I immediately open my door and the driver is pulling off. I waved my hands to stop her but she never stopped. The driver never came to my door. I have a Ring cam and it caught her driving away in her white car. I immediately contacted Amazon through the app they said they would have the package redelivered later on in the day. I also contacted Amazon personally to complain on the driver and let them know what happened. They advised me of the same thing that they would reroute the package to be delivered later on. The package never came. I sat inside all day waiting on this driver. I missed out on a hotel stay that cost me $150 for one night. I’m extremely upset at both the  Amazon driver and Amazon for not having this package delivered on time. I also needed the package before I went out of town and wasted a whole day sitting inside. Amazon customer service advised  me not to leave  and said this they cannot give me a time of delivery. This is not the first time this has happened with my package. ,2024,05,May,2024,7.0,1.0,low

1400,GB,Feeling annoyed and frustrated ,"It is impossible to obtain a truthful response from the Amazon customer service team, and there is no avenue to escalate the issue and file an official complaint. I am frustrated with the constant lies I am told whenever an item goes missing or is delivered late. Yesterday, I ordered scattering urns for my parents' ashes, with an expected delivery time between 1.30 and 3.30 pm today.  When I checked the tracking information, it showed the driver parked near my house without any movement for hours. Upon contacting customer service through live chat, I was assured that the items were still out for delivery, despite evidence to the contrary. After speaking with multiple representatives, I was given conflicting information about the delivery attempt. Ultimately, I was informed that the item would still be delivered, but it was already late in the evening and unlikely to arrive today. To my dismay, the delivery date was suddenly changed to the 29th of May. This is not the first time such issues have occurred, and despite promises of refunds for the inconvenience, I have never received them. It seems that Amazon's customer service team protects each other, as there is no effective way to lodge a complaint against them. Unfortunately, it appears that sharing my negative experiences on review platforms like Trustpilot will not result in any action being taken. So I’m probably wasting my time writing this review as nothing will happen as usual ",2024,05,May,2024,3.0,1.0,low
1401,US,The last person i spoke with was very…,"The last person i spoke with was very rude, and was basically telling me that it's my fault that my order was delivered messed up. I ordered the shorts needing them for an event tomorrow, but they were delivered today ripped. So, now not only do i have to go out spend more money to buy more, and even told her i didn't want or need the refund that i still want the shorts only to be told that a replacement was unavailable and that i need to send in the shorts and wait for them to be received processed before i can be refunded, so i simply asked are you kidding me then she wants to get an attitude saying no she isn't kidding and that it can take 30 days or more to get them processed for a refund i still even asked if there was any way possible for me to get my refund into my Ammazon gift card balance so that i could order another pair to which she was again rude as hell saying no i had to not only wait the 30 plus days for the refund to be issued but i have to wait another 10 days for it to go back to my card. So, satisfied sadly after this refund is processed i will no longer bee ordering anything from Amazon again, and i took screen shots of the conversation and how rude this person was and i will be on every platform i can find leaving reviews about this. So, not only did Amazon lose me as a customer today but they also lost everyone of my family members and friends that use Amazon. We will be ordering from TikTok shop and ebay from now on. TikTok shop usually has better prices and neither one of them have ever been rude like this to me before and never have i ever had something delivered to me ripped up and i get blamed basically for it and get told I'm basically screwed on getting my money back for a month and a half. I have only had one package come messed up from another place and i contacted customer support and they gave me a choice of getting refunded or i could have the same thing i ordered mailed out that day, to wait on my money for a month and a half is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable especially when it's either Amazon's fault or the delivery company THEY USED to have my order delivered. I guess you guys at Amazon forget that us customers are the ones that keep you employed and for you to treat your customers that spend alot of money with you the way you treated me is beyond crazy. But hey losing around 10-15 prime customers in one day is no sweat for y'all even though one single person is the one that made these 10-15 prime customers leave. So, congrats Amazon keep it up and I'm sure you'll be losing alot more.

1403,CA,ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE! ZERO RESPECT & APPRECIATION FROM AMAZON!!  ,"I decided to share my experience in dealing with Amazon, especially it’s negative flows. 1. There is no transparency from some vendors, especially from China, about return policy and shipping. I had to deal a few times with situations when the company claims their merchandise is refundable, but in fact they want you to pay for the return out of your own pocket! This is SCAM!! 2. Encountered problems with ordering dog’s treats and supplements. Dog treats were extremely dry and old! The supplements came EXPIRED and total ignore from the company to my complains and no refund!! 😡😡 “No refund on pets supplements “ message was only was provided when I tried to return it. THIS IS ALSO SCAM!!! 😡😡3. Like probably for many other people, I find that some prices are much higher than in stores for identical products! 4. I’m sick and tired to see unreasonably high “delivery” fees added to the price tag! This is again especially true for the Chinese vendors. 5. I find it that delivery home, here in Toronto, is disgusting!! Our camera captured a few time like delivery men toss the packages to the ground instead of carefully placing it. Noteworthy to mention how they take the pictures when they leave the package near your door. Once they sent my son a picture of a completely wrong package with a computer keyboard. The picture captured square type of box, where the keyboard no way could have even fit it. The actual package has NEVER arrived!! Once in Toronto a delivery man text me that he couldn’t find my address (😱🙄) and gave me only 5 min to respond back. They obviously don’t think and don’t care, that a person may not see a text within 5 min or be unavailable. I got a feeling he even didn’t try to delivered as it was a day after some minor snowfall! For delivery they ask for any “special instructions”; mine was “please ALWAYS ring the bell!” No, they don’t bother and don’t care that thefts are not only possible, but are very common now! 6. The worse thing of all, that if you encounter any problem, there is no one to contact to resolve an issue immediately or even EVER!! This company obviously DOES NOT CARE about customers satisfaction!!! They are blinded by all the money they get from us, yet treat people without any due respect!! 7. Amazon encounters very serious PROBLEMS SECURING CUSTOMERS’ PERSONAL INFORMATION and this is a NO-NO!! 😡😡🙏I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with many business and customer service aspects of this company and will STOP or drastically REDUCE my dealing to the necessary minimum!

If the seller has product in stock, ""they"" ship it and charge a delivery fee. If they do not have it in stock, but Amazon has it in their warehouse, Amazon ships it directly, with no delivery fee added. Yeah, that sounds totally backwards, but that was the information we received from Amazon Customer Service. We stated in our review that this is not a ""customer first"" approach, because Amazon does not clearly notify the buyer about this practice.

This has happened probably 30 to 50 times charging me anywhere from 2-4 times the same amount in my EBT account, usually on the same day but at different times. I have tried to resolve these overcharges with customer service but to no avail. There may be a government website that I can contact because of fraudulent charges on my EBT card. I have proof of all these transactions.  Amazon does not let you file an online review of their company on their website.  They will take reviews of any of the products you purchased, but nowhere does it let you make any comments about their company.Amazon truly doesn't seem to care about its customers.  It is ridiculous they are trying to rob the EBT customers, EBT customers are the ones who are already in dire straights financially.I will be glad to update this issue if it gets resolved.

I was at home all day and no delivery van appeared, and the access to our house is always clear.  I looked on my Amazon order page, and it advised me to contact Evri.  I really tried to do this.  There is no option on Evri's site to speak to a human being, so I left a message on their chatbot explaining the problem.  They didn't reply, but instead left me a message saying they had tried to deliver again and still couldn't.  This is nonsense.  Whoever they are trying to deliver to, it's not to our address.  On my Amazon account it now says that Evri have paused the delivery until I contact them with more information.  What information?! And how am I supposed to do this, when they won't talk to me?!!Instead I contacted Amazon customer service and asked for a refund for the items.  The agent told me that they couldn't request a refund until the following day, so he would phone me back today.  Today he sent me an email saying he can't get through on my number, I don't know why, and that I need to call Amazon back.

Remember this was an ""Indian CSR"".Just now, i had problem with an order; it was elligable for partial refund; when i talked with a CSR, an english speaking lady picked up and she was very polite and gentle and told me that i am elligable for 40-45% partial refund; i wanted to talk with my wife for the decision so i thanked her and hung up; after that i called again and this time an Indian CSR picked up and he plainly told me that i am elligable for only 30% refund; and i was like ""whattt"" and i told him that just now i spoken with a CSR and she told me that i had 40-45 % refund; hearing this the Indian guy simply got confused and told me that its a ""special refund"" and that he will see that i am elligable; after some time he said that ok i am elligable for ""special refund"".So guys be aware, keep on calling AMAZON CSRs until you met with an English speaking person, they seem to have ""more morality"" than the Indian CSRs.",2024,05,May,2024,1.0,1.0,low

They told me the colour could not be found in the warehouse and therefore they would cancel my order. I asked them if it would be possible to get a different colour (at the time of ordering multiple other colours were also available for the promotional price).After some discussion Amazon agreed to sell me 8 pair of socks in a colour of my choice. They even promissed me an additional discount of 10% and refund of the shipping costs because of all the hassle.They told me I had to cancel my orders and order these socks at the current price. They would than refund me the difference in price once I received the orders, as well as the 10% discount and the shipping costs.To make sure I understood correctly I even send them a calculation of what refund the would be giving me (the price was more than double compared to the promotional price). They confirmed I understood everything correctly and I wouldn't have to worry.So I ordered 8 pair of socks and send Amazon an message to receive the refund. However, Amazon refused to give me the promised refund.I have had long message conversations as well as 2 phone calls for over an hour with the help desk. During these calls the Amazon employees agreed with me and promised me to arrange the refund. Afterwards I got written messages that I have been misinformed and that they can't/won't give me the refund.Finally, I have returned the 8 pair of socks to get my money back.

There is absolutely zero customer service from anyone at Amazon. You cannot get to speak to someone and when you go on chat it just loops you round and round.

Streaming music is available from so many different companies and several are compatible with Amazon Echo devices, so there's no problem there.

I could could go into the vast number of problems that now exist with the company, but it would take days and most people are probably already aware. I'm starting to feel like I am always on the phone with a representative who ""can't help"", but will escalate my case, which of course, means you will never hear from them again.

These tactics include:Anti-discounting measures that punish sellers and deter other online retailers from offering prices lower than Amazon, keeping prices higher for products across the internet. For example, if Amazon discovers that a seller is offering lower-priced goods elsewhere, Amazon can bury discounting sellers so far down in Amazon’s search results that they become effectively invisible.Conditioning sellers’ ability to obtain “Prime” eligibility for their products—a virtual necessity for doing business on Amazon—on sellers using Amazon’s costly fulfillment service, which has made it substantially more expensive for sellers on Amazon to also offer their products on other platforms. This unlawful coercion has in turn limited competitors’ ability to effectively compete against Amazon.Amazon’s illegal, exclusionary conduct makes it impossible for competitors to gain a foothold. With its amassed power across both the online superstore market and online marketplace services market, Amazon extracts enormous monopoly rents from everyone within its reach.

One for the local (read: American) people and one for the international (read: Chinese) sellers.I recently helped someone local setting up an Amazon Seller’s Account. What a tedious, strenuous experience. Lots of documents and information required: driver license, proof of residency, bank and credit card details, business address, description and references, verified phone numbers and email addresses, name of business owners, company representative, nationality, etc…etc…etc…I understand, Amazon is protecting its brand and wants to weed out bogus operations to protect itself and sellers, right?Well, I got a big surprise when I had to contact Amazon concerning a failing product sold by a third party vendor (read: Chinese).(1) impossible to contact the seller directly, no information about the seller is listed. Only the name is provided (let’s say ABC)(2) contacting the seller is only possible through the Messaging Assistant who states: “I send your message to ABC”. Since no response from seller is received, I contacted Customer Service Support for help getting in contact with the vendor directly.And here it gets juicy. The Agent also did not find any contact information about seller ABC. Agent escalated the question higher up to a Lead Agent who came back empty handed. No information is available about company ABC.How is that possible? Since I experienced personally how though the vetting procedure is to set up shop on the Amazon platform and all the verified contact details that needed to be provided before a sellers account can be opened, here is a third party vendor (read: Chinese) company ABC selling on the Amazon website and nobody knows how to get in contact with them.In the meantime and that because of the staggering complains about their faulty product(s), company ABC changed its name into XYZ apparently without any scrutiny by Amazon. That way, company XYZ does not need to reply to complains about products it did not sell. They keep selling same unsound products using same templates on the Amazon portal.

And so, in a fit of exasperation, I was forced to resort to the drastic measure of creating a whole new account just to make a simple purchase.

1612,NL,My nightmare with amazon customer…,"My nightmare with amazon customer service started off a few days before Christmas when I ordered a gift for my parents. A few days after placing the order, I checked my letterbox on my way back from work to find that my package from Amazon had been delivered to my neighbours, however, it was not specified which neighbours the package was delivered to. Bear in mind, I live in an apartment block with over 100 residents. So I put up a sign on the entrance asking if anyone has received my package to please contact me. I also contacted amazon asking them where my package is exactly. Consequently, Amazon launched an investigation with the courier and found that there is no further information as to where the package was delivered and as a result starts a refund process. So far so good. However, after waiting for more than a full week, I still did not receive my refund and there are no further updates from Amazon. Therefore, I called customer service, spelled out my unbelievably long university email about 3 times before they got it right for them to check what the refund status was. They then assured me that all is in order and that I will receive my money soon. Nevertheless, days passed and I still did not receive a refund. So I decided to call again. After giving the customer service worker all my details they told me that my account had been blocked due to an outstanding payment on Amazon.es, although I live in Germany and order from Amazon.de. Therefore, the refund has also been blocked. As a result, they escalated the issue and promised me that I would receive my money as this outstanding order nonsense made no sense. Nevertheless, a week went by and my bank account was still 160 euros short. Consequently, I called a third time to ask what the situation was. Bear in mind, each time I call I have to explain my situation from the beginning and carry out the verification procedure of repeating my long and complex email address and home address. After explaining my situation, customer service once again told me that they have made a mistake and that my refund will be issued. Nevertheless, the EXACT same thing happened as last time. I didn't hear back from them for days and my refund never arrived. At this point I am 3 calls and several emails in with absolutely no progress.Subsequently, I called a fourth time to figure out what the hell was going on. This time I was forwarded to someone higher up in the customer service rankings. After almost one hour on the phone, the lady assured me that she would tend to the issue herself. Once this has been done, she would call me back with the final outcome. It was already 630 pm after work when the call was coming to an end. Nevertheless, she told me that she was working until midnight and would call me back before then. So I literally stayed awake until midnight waiting for a call which never arrived. At this point I really wanted to give up but it is a lot of money for me so I checked my emails 2 days later only to see that my account has been unblocked but there is no sign of a refund. As a result, I called a 5th time now. This time I insisted on a solution on the spot. After almost an hour on the call and the customer service employee talking to his superiors while I was on hold, I was told that the final decision is that no refund will be issued. Well, let me explain their logic. Apparently, a one time pickup code was issued to me and given to the courier.

Bassoon as I looked at the package I knew it was incorrect as soon as I looked at it  as I had ordered a 100 Vit D tablets and the packaging was a standard A4 Amazon envelope. You could never get a tub of 100 vitamin tablets in that. What's more there was absolutely nothing in the envelope not even a sheet of paper.  Customer services are worse than useless.

Basically a free pool of floating money for Amazon at your expense. I do not want to name other sellers out there, but if all the products come from China, why pay the middle man for crappy service when I can get them less expensive directly from Chinese sellers.

Amazon offered a simple refund as compensation. This is absolutely absurd! A refund does not come close to addressing the potential health risks my child may have faced.I am utterly disgusted that Amazon considers a measly £5 sufficient compensation for potentially exposing my child to harmful chemicals. Their response is shockingly dismissive of a very serious situation.This experience raises serious concerns about the safety of products sold on Amazon and their handling of product recalls. Parents trust them with the well-being of their children, and this kind of nonchalant response is completely unacceptable.Other parents, please be aware! Check your cupboards for these recalled drops and take immediate action to protect your child's health. Furthermore, I urge Amazon to take product safety and recalls much more seriously.

So along with other customer's reviews about the disgusting PRICE GOUGING, I added my review. This was 2020. Mine was REJECTED. And from then on no matter how wonderful a review I wrote they found some reason to say it didn't follow ""AMAZON GUIDELINES""!! WELL here is my LAST AMAZON REVIEW ever and AMAZON can't touch it!! What you are doing is a disservice to your customers!!!! You aren't hurting me. I will add this,"" I spend a LOT LESS$$$$ on AMAZON"" I use to spend around $500- $1,000 a month or more. Now, maybe $100.Love the products ,not the lack of appreciation of me and my loyalty as a customer. So go ahead and support the PRICE GOUGERS, the corrupt.

1704,AU,Horrid site with a lack of transparency and lack of easy access,"I have two email addresses linked to amazon site for Australia and USA. One business and one personal,  and I'm unable to log in with either of the emails on the Amazon.au. Therefore have attempted to change password but the process has been ridiculous because of it continuously being repetitive with puzzle solving and input matching. I've used the visual and audio etc, and it never stops and never completes the process even though I've continuously input correctly. I've tried to contact customer service and yet that continuously goes around in circles too, leading me back to the repetitive process that never ends.I have products on amazon.au and tried to contact them to find out why they have deliberately increased the pricing to 3 times the amount than I nominated. For example, a book in paperback is higher than the hardcover of the same title. Why would they do that to a producer of a product and certainly discourage a sale for the most popular customer preference. The fact I cannot get past log in process and they blatantly make it impossible to question why they have nominated to make a producers product pricing questionable does really spell a lack of transparency for the company. When it comes down to me being a customer, the site is certainly losing sales from me and for the sellers because they don't make it easy to log in to an account to make a purchase. Poor form and very unprofessional.P.S, It does make me question their selling tactics. Do they have staff on retainers or commission who also sell their own products on the site? Therefore, pushing their own products to make sales above all other sellers and do their staff have a place in listing other sellers product pricing, only to cause a dire affect to deter customers from purchasing thus the other sellers products which would only give advantage to the staff products being reasonably priced to influence sales for themselves.I know of another site that I have become very familiar with over the past 5 years who are doing the same thing and it became obvious by their marketing emails with the same old artists products being in the emails, high up in search on the site, and always in the artists spotlight.

1710,US,"Worth customer service on the planet, what happened?","Amazon customer service is the worst I’ve ever experienced, or, I should say, has become that. This year marks the worst so far, and it’s only April. Nobody trains the agents what to do except lie, or they do not understand what you say to them. You can even water it down so anyone could understand it but they're always lost. At the beginning of the year, I had to update my phone number. It took a month of working with the BBB to even attempt that. A billion agents each telling something asinine, thinking I’d believe it being they made constant assurances that never go anywhere. They are surely trained in that.I had to give them my blacked-out ID to merely update a bloody phone number that was easier with my bank, pharmacy and post office. After all, this whole country is based on phone numbers and codes when not involving targeted ads. The former is what finally after almost a month got my number updated after all their insanely ridiculous replies to the BBB case, which shows how dense and clueless they are. It sadly gets worse.That same month, I received two items damaged beyond repair. An agent two months ago said there was no need to return the item. I have screenshots. If you mention this, they seemingly panic and lie some more. Weirdly, there are screenshots, but the mere mention of such things sends them into a frenzy. The agents in turn assure more things which they never bothered to do, like a refund for one. Two months later, I received  an email to return the item I was told to never send back. Screenshots tell the truth. They naturally took the money out after saying that if you’re charged, meaning you will be, we will reimburse you. They took it out twice.  Another agent said he fixed it and issued it, but there was no confirmation email. More screenshots. Always take them, or they’ll just lie some more. Of course, in essence it’s all they do when not assuring it is fixed and leads to more issues. I thought to check if the refund even went through two days later, but I never received a confirmation email, so I merely engaged to check. An hour later, I was promised four months of free Prime because the other agent lied about issuing a refund just two days earlier. I found out from the third agent during one chat alone (many get lost and transfer to another sometimes even more lost) for a simple issue (checking the status of non-existent and promised refunds). Amazon also conveniently and quite stupidly have no reference or ticket numbers for any chat so future agents won’t be as lost as they always are. Lovely. This agent was as nice as most are, but clearly in over his head. I took billions of screenshots, but I am fearful all the promises will lead to more chats from hell. I know nobody wants to work there since Rocket Boy is so cheap; there’s nothing worse than the people working there. 2024 has already been an absolute nightmare.  Always use chat so you can get screenshots of these fake promises. The emails have no reference numbers, as is now policy so ask for chat transcripts. Good luck in getting concrete answers for anything, as it’s all assurances to seem nice while they mislead you, or outright lie until you get the next lying agent. Fix this now, Rocket Boy.",2024,04,April,2024,1.0,1.0,low

1717,US,"""Reputable and customer-centric"" becomming a ""used to be"" reality!","I have mostly had good luck with Amazon over the years, but it's my most recent experiences that have me not ""smiling"".I recently ordered a new set of Sony surround speakers that were part of a renovation of what we call our ""sunroom"". When the ""new"" speakers arrived, one of the main tower speakers and the set of two Atmos ceiling-directed speakers were obvious returns. The tower speaker was without the soft foam ""sock"" that keeps it from being scratched and the Atmos speakers were carelessly wrapped in the soft foam (hanging half off) plus there were the remains of speaker wires being previously attached. I sent the tower speaker back to get another one and Amazon would only do a credit to the account and not a refund. I kept the Atmos speakers as they seem to work ok, but I felt cheated. These items should have been sold as ""warehouse"" items at a reduced price. New is new and not kind-of new and we pay a premium price for that privilege. The most recent problem was with a lightening arrester that I needed. I bought an item that would work with standard coax used by satellite and cable companies but received an item that was for larger coax. I sent it back for another one only to get the same wrong item. I'm now dealing directly with the producer of the item who is correcting the situation.After having the problem myself, I have since read where others have experienced the same problems. To add to the problem, Amazon has made it impossible to find and actual contact phone number where you can talk to a human to right things.

1750,NO,"Amazon hustled me, was not given refund","I bought a pair of shoes, and I got a date when they should arrive. They did not arrive, and suddenly a new date was set, with a message they were delayed. This second date also passed, with no shoes and no further tracking info avaliable. I waited for a while, but then I reached out to customer serive by chat. I was told the item seemed to be lost or stolen along the way. I was asked to get new shoes. However, I was starting to be in a hurry for the date when I needed the shoes, and with normal delivery, I would not get them in time. I was then offered free express shipping. I was told i had to pay for it, but when the item arrived I was told to contact customer support again for a refund for the expenses of the express shipping. I was also told the chat would be stored so that i did not have to tell the whole story again. As this was promised to me, I aggreed to have the shoes sent another time, with express shipping. This time the item reached me as it was supposed to. I then contacted customer service again, but the person i got to talk to then, knew nothing about it. I had to explain everything all over again, and in the end I was told some other department or whatever had to handle it, and they would contact me within a day or so. I heard nothing from anyone after that. So now I tried again, as I am still missing the refund for the cost of the express shipping. I would not have bought the shoes otherwice, and at this point I would have been able to buy the shoes somewhere else for less. I was put in chat with first one person today, who sent me on to someone else in another department, that again left the chat so i had to start from scratch again with someone else for the 5th time. This person just telles me i was wrongly informed and they will not refund me anything. I used to think Amazon was a deasent company, and I was really not happy to be hustled like that. I have saved the entire chat history and can document everything, but when someone at their company has told me something wrong, they still let me as a customer be the looser. What happened to ""we are sorry, of course you'll have the refund, there must have been a misunderstanding on our behalf""?Never shopping at Amazon again, and i strongly recomant the same for everyone else.

1764,US,How far the Mighty Amazon has Fallen ,"I can't begin to describe how far Amazon has fallen over the years.  I was a customer from the beginning.  I was with Prime shortly after it came out.  I seriously thought it was the best company in the world, until it wasn't.  Then it wasn't even close.  Amazon now has among the worst customer service I encounter anywhere.  It rivals Comcast and Verizon Fios for the worst service you can even conceive of.  There's literally no way to describe the thousand ways Amazon fails at basic stuff.  It's service is a nightmare now.  You're sent off to a foreign country, with people who are supremely unhelpful, with the simplest issues taking hours to resolve.  I'm over it.  I no longer trust Amazon.  It's that simple.  Most recent case in point: I called Synchrony Bank, the issuer of the Amazon store card, to pay my bill.  It said the balance was over $400, so I thought I'd go through to a live person and see what the purchases were, to make sure nothing was unauthorized.  I recognized every purchase, except one.  There was an $11 charge for Amazon digital services.  I knew I hadn't authorized any digital purchases, so told them to put me through to Amazon.  The Indian man I spoke with was completely unhelpful.  Mind you, I mean him or anyone else no disrespect for being foreign.  He spoke with a thick accent likely because English was his second language.  GOOD FOR HIM.  It's something to be proud of.  But it also makes it very difficult to take care of issues that have any degree of complexity at all. He insisted I definitely ordered Amazon Music Unlimited, because I played [unintelligible] on my Alexa device.  What was the name of it?  ""It was [unintelligible]""  HUH?  SAY THAT AGAIN SLOWLY?  Literally, his accent was so thick I couldn't tell at all what he was saying.  After repeating it a fourth time, I made out the word ""noise.""  It hit me that Amazon was charging me $11 a month to play ""brown noise"" on my bedroom Alexa device.  I've played that as a background sleep noise for YEARS.  Didn't start in December.  I've literally played it for about 3-5 years, every single night.  Suddenly it apparently started charging me for it in December.  I never heard it ask me ANYTHING about a subscription and certainly never agreed to any such thing.  But that didn't convince this Amazon rep, who apparently could read my mind and insisted I absolutely did order it.  I grew increasingly annoyed, especially as he kept going silent for 20, 30, 40 seconds at a time without saying a word, no hold or anything.. just silence.  Finally I told him, ""why are you being silent?  I don't know what you're doing.""  He then hung up on me.  So much for customer service.  I called angrier now and spoke with a second rep.  She was so very sorry the first rep hung up on me.  If I would just take more time out of my Saturday night to explain everything all over again and verify myself again... which I had no choice but to do.  She took a complaint on the last rep, but said she couldn't help me.  I'd have to be transferred to Amazon music.  Mind you, by this time it's nearly 1 am in the morning on a Sunday morning.  She puts me on hold... and I wait and I wait and wait some more.  About 15 minutes she comes back and says ""I'm sorry for the long wait.  I'm still in the queue to speak with Amazon music.""  I told her I would wait.  She puts me back on hold... 20 minutes pass... 30 minutes pass... 40 minutes pass.  Finally I had to give up.  She never came back on the line to say anything.  Just the same canned music playing over and over and over and over on a loop.  Called again.  Asked for a supervisor, but my phone died because I'd been held on the line so long.  He didn't call back.  I gave up because I had to give up.  Otherwise, I'd have a stroke from my anger and high blood pressure.  Amazon, you suck. Every single time I have a problem now, this is what I encounter.  Amazon is no longer a great company.  It's a company that will cut every corner, that disrespects its customers and their time, and that cares only about its bottom line.  It will go the way of Sears because it deserves to.

I noticed an unauthorised payment going out of my bank account to Amazon.com, now I have been a prime member with Amazon.Co.uk since 2011 and I have spent a lot of money with them. Now I contacted Amazon.Co.uk customer service regarding this unauthorised payment, they told me because the account was set up with Amazon.com. That it was Amazon.com that I had to contact, which I did so I explained to them the details of the payment. And I also told that this payment dated back to July 2018, so everyone please check your bank accounts and make sure that they haven’t set up a bogus account whereby you are paying them a monthly subscription by either paying it to Amazon.com or Amazon.Co.uk. Now as I have mentioned I have been paying for something that I have never used, and the payment has amounted up to £700+, the account was set up via a visa payment. Now I will give them a little bit of credit, because after contacting them they have paid me back 22 months. But I have be paying for the subscription for a total of 81 months, but if they can pay me back for some of the money. Why can’t they pay me back the full amount, now during the passed few years I have been of ill health due to becoming disabled and been on a lot of medication which has had an impact on my mental health and I am more or less sure that if I would of had my facilities I would of picked up on this pay sooner rather than later. All this has been explained to them, but they are telling me that there system will only allow them to go back so far. And that there system won’t allow them to be able to generate a payment no further than the 22 months. I have spoke to Amazon.com via there chat room so that I have got some kind of record of what has been said, and I have also been in contact with them via telephone calls. If they had decided to reimburse me the full amount, I will be perfectly honest with you. I don’t think that I would be writing this review, but I am glad in a way that they haven’t paid me back the full amount.

Our family Amazon account has been fully hacked, and our hacker easily managed to change our account phone number, email and password on our Amazon account without a single barrier stopping that hacker. Now our hacker has access to our home address and bank cards in our Amazon account, which is really worrying. We received an email from Amazon that our old email address A has been changed to the new email address B, which was shocking because we never changed our email address. Amazon could have send us a link in that same email to give an option to undo this email change if it wasn't us, something that all big companies have for their customer account like gmail. Or Amazon could have send a code to our phone number or old email address that our hacker needed access to before that hacker could change our account email address or password so basically some sort of security barrier, but clearly Amazon thought that there was no need for any of these barrier even if everyones Amazon account contains peoples bank card and personal details plus our hacker can freely order stuff on our account and properly will do other suspicious acts. Who ever made Amazon website have clearly lacked some simple security standards. I called Amazon customer service (which Amazon customer service was hard to find because we didn't have access to our Amazon account) and they said that they cannot close our account that has been hacked because the email and phone number has been changed by our hacker and we also can no longer access it.",2024,04,April,2024,1.0,1.0,low

1932,GB,Delivery driver said he handed me parcel but I wasn't in. No refund or replacement from amazon. Amazon Awful. ,"I am so distressed and upset at the way I have been dealt with by Amazon today. I used to think they were a good company. Not now. My deliveries used to arrive. Not now. So basically I ordered a couple of small items that would have fitted in the mailbox today. I got an email they would be delivered by 9pm. I was out of my apartment for about an hour. When I came back I checked my amazon account and it said my item had been delivered and handed to resident. Which it hadn't. This really annoyed me as it had not been delivered I was not in and it had not been handed to me. I really hate it when a delivery driver says they have handed something to you when they have not as its a complete lie. I live in an apt on the first floor and all I want is for someone to ring my bell and hand me my delivery. This rarely happens. I have written clear delivery instructions which are never read and I've complained before. If I'm not in go to my apt on first floor and leave outside my door. I don't want it thrown outside and I don't want it thrown downstairs in a communal area. I don't what it handed to people that live in other apts that I don't even know. So it takes me ages to find amazon's customer service number. As they keep changing it. Then I've to listen to lots of recorded stuff. The call gets cut off and I phone back. Then I have to go through a painstakingly long process to give my number and my email several times repeating every letter. Then they say there's no account with my email and my number despite me using amazing for years. Then finally then I've to go into my email. I can't understand the person I'm talking to they can't understand me. Why can't amazon employ people in local areas to deal with local issues. It's insanely hard dealing with amazon. I wasted hours today and it's after midnight and I'm still upset. I'm told sorry to hear you didn't receive your item I will help you. Then I'm transferred to some other team logistics or something and I got the rudest woman I've ever encountered on a phone call jia or something I honestly didn't get her name. I really wanted to report her for being absolutely horrific and completely upsetting me. She had zero empathy. I told her I just wanted what I had ordered as I had paid amazon and it was meant to be here. I said just send it next day delivery or give me a refund. She said no they were launching an investigation whatever the hell that means. And you have to wait 3 days! Hold on I've already waited 3 days for delivery and now I've to wait another 3 days. Before I can even get a refund or replacement. Are these jokers for real? With a guy that has lied about giving my parcel to me as I was not physically there. Where the hell do these parcels go? I have a severe back injury and one of the items was to help that and I was going into hospital in a few days I said look please just send out what I ordered. She had zero empathy and just kept taking over me saying only when the investigation has concluded. I said I will be in hospital then. She couldn't care less. I also said well the delivery driver has obviously lied that he handed me the parcel and I can prove I wasn't in. She then kept talking over me very negatively zero empathy and finally hung up! I've actually been in tears over her attitude and it's ruined my day. I phoned back again to complain about her but of course I couldn't as you get through to a call centre that couldn't care less. There's no official customer service team. I go through the whole drawn out process again with a nicer girl this time but still saying no refund no replacement. How is this even legal? Amazon failed to deliver what I paid for and already waited 3 days for. And now I've to wait another 3 days.  I asked to speak to a manager and then it was, the same robotic response our policy is bla bla bla. No human empathy. This is not on. Amazon need to get delivery drivers that deliver and stop telling lies that they have handed you a parcel. I feel like cancelling amazon account and I wish there was a better place I could order from. Thus whole experience has ruined my day. And I've been in tears and stressed out. Now I've to wait for the outcome of an investigation with a delivery driver who has already lied as he didn't hand me the parcel. Amazon sucks and I really dislike this company now and want nothing to do with them. I need the items that I ordered and they told me to order again but there's no guarantee I will get them and I have to wait 3 days if I even get a refund. I don't think this is legal. And Amazon are horrific now. I will be looking into ordering elsewhere. Amazon make out that you're almost not telling the truth or something. It's absolutely horrific customer service and if you've an injury or disability amazon couldn't care less. Inhuman and awful company now. Used to be brilliant. Very annoyed and disappointed.

I received a one time passcode or OTP as they refer to it. I greeted the amazon delivery person, I gave him the passcode several times- he kept repeating it back incorrectly. I took the package and remarked to my girlfriend that man they make macs light these days. I opened the package to find an obviously used and abused macbook box. I opened the box with an ever increasing heart rate as I knew at this point my worst fears were about to be realized. It was EMPTY! My girlfriend rushed out the door to the driver who was just down the street. He stated you want to look in the back of my truck? Nothing I can do, call amazon support. Of course I called right away. I sat on hold for at least 30-40 mins. Amazon's first attempt at resolving the issue was to tell me there was nothing that could be done since I gave them the OTP- they stated I should call the police???!!!! When I refused and stated I had already wasted my day with this whole situation they put me on hold again for many minutes. They finally returned and refunded my order. This person refunded me with the most disgust I've ever experienced in my years of customer service. She quickly said bye, none of the usual thanks for being an amazon customer... Little did I know the issues would only continue from here. Later that evening I received an email stating my account had most likely been hacked and all my orders were cancelled. Next I came to find out that any order around $100+ would require a OTP- meaning they send you a passcode via email a couple hrs before your order arrives that you're forced to give to the delivery person- meaning you have to be present all day long if you actually want to receive your order. That's exactly the opposite of what amazon was designed to be. I called in multiple times to have this obstruction / inconvenience removed. One person from logistics stated maybe I should buy my macbook from apple like he did? I asked if he ever bought anything on amazon for $100+ he stated no. After talking to several more people from all over the world one person agreed to give me a partial refund of around $79 of the $139 I was so exhausted I agreed to it. I now realize that it makes no sense, given it's only almost April 1st and a prorated refund would be $100+??? This has been a pretty ridiculous experience to say the least.

This last agent told me that there is no way my order can be recovered and that there is no such $15 credit in my account. Confused and upset I’m just speechless about this whole experience. I would recommend against Amazon.com at all cost. If you can order with another provider who values their promises and delivers quality , trust me it’s worth the extra dollar. Avoid dealing with their empty promises and poor quality (both services and goods).PS: there is still no resolution to my problem or any reasonable contact/communication with Amazon.comThe whole thing has literally turned from a computer/model error into a human led poor customer service.

Amazon Export Services (AES) employs the cheapest 1* rated companies for international deliveries. It makes it imposdible to record a complaint. It tells a lot of lies on its invoice about how it will handle import processes. In New Zealabd, if your package is worth more than 1000 nzd, for which you have already paid import fees, your package sits in limbo forever. Aramex NZ, which Anazon employs, is a frachisee provider. There is one customs broker who tells a lot of lies about how the the package is due soon, when it has been held by customs for 17days. Mr Azmir Siddiqui (AamirS- his domain name is aramex.com in case you need to put his contact details together) is not inclined to respond to emails. The contact centre is in the phillipines and likely to hang up on you. Aamir is a bottleneck and nothing happens. He probably has too much paperwork in between delivery of 1* rated uber eats. Mr Danny Murphy, supposedluly the Canterbury General Manager of Aramex NZ (1.3* rating only because you cannot rate zero) is uncontactable. This is Amazon for you.

It’s false advertising.,I purchased a Samsung S24 phone on Amazon for a family member because she requested it due to the $150 Amazon.com Promo Credit that was included with the phone. Their promo credit allows the buyer to spend $150 on items sold and shipped by Amazon. Seemed like a good deal for someone who wants to buy some extra accessories or other items.The instructions clearly said that the promo was applied automatically and that the buyer would receive an email after the phone gets delivered. The phone was delivered 2 days ago and still no Amazon promo credit. I spoken to 12 customer service agents and NONE of them knew wth they were talking about and gave non-sensical responses. They acted like the promo didn’t exist and asked me to send them links and screenshots to the phone even though they have my order and can see the product listing. I eventually gave up and my relative (who was already disappointed by this) asked for the phone to be returned. I went online to see if anyone else had this experience and I saw posts the past months where other buyers had the same problem.

2121,GB,Excelling in Variety and Choice ,"- A customer of 8 YearsAs a company in terms of offering customers value it  undeniably does so. I dont use their software services much as I already had spotify/ youtube but have still got value from prime delivery through their food and items as well as occasional prime video and audible. There's more they can be doing environmentally to offset such a large footprint but due to how logistically efficient they are it brings down the CO2 emissions per parcel compared to driving to collect the same item yourself! They can also invest in electric or alterenative fuel methods for their vehicles.Paper and cardboard packaging on all orders is recyclable/reusable and I've been able to support small online/sustainable businesses through the marketplace The shopping experience is excellent and the delivery very professional.The value offered is great, and with such a large selection of products and reviews its not difficult to find what you're after. The tracking and history of orders is exceptional, as well as the ability to create multiple lists (wish lists) that could be shared.Used items can also be found on the platform too, which is a better choice for the environment than brand new, I've recently found a growing offering of recycled plastic items which is even better as it creates a demand to get the products out of our environment.I barely touched on the software/ streaming applications and services offered which is a large part of the subscription and could be worth the monthly fee in it's own right.I'd be quite surprised if you had anything but a positive experience. I can't comment from an empoyee/ seller side of the company but as a customer I keep coming back and will continue to aslong as I receive great service. As buyers we need to continue to carefully consider the demand our purchases place on the environment but it's good to know that Amazon can align with this goal shoud we choose to.I look forward to seeing more sustainably powered vans adopted and encouragement for smaller local and quality goods sellers promoted on the home page.",2024,03,March,2024,6.0,5.0,high

I began searching online to see if anyone else had encountered the same issue. I found an email address where I could file a complaint. They responded stating: ‘as already communicated to you, we have closed this account. From our records, we have previously terminated your account for violating the terms of our user agreement. Following termination of your account due to breach of contract, you are not permitted to open a new account or use another account to place orders on our site. Following a thorough evaluation, we have decided not to restore your full access to this account. It will therefore not be possible for you to place orders on our site. Any digital content purchased with this account is still available to you. To access the content, click the Manage content and devices link in the My Orders menu on Amazon.it.’ Despite my attempts to seek clarification, they provided the same generic responses, failing to explain the exact reason for the account termination and how I violated the terms of the agreement. Furthermore, they mentioned that I could still access digital content purchased with the account, which was untrue since my account was closed, leaving me without access to anything.Adding insult to injury, I own a Kindle that was linked to my account.

However, that night when I opened my Kindle, it was EMPTY!!! All my books were gone! And on the screen was the login page to the Amazon account, which I no longer had access to. Here arises an interesting question: how did they learn that my account was closed if my device was not connected to Wi-Fi? This implies that Amazon has another means of controlling my data and my device. All the books I downloaded, all the notes I made in the books, all the progress I made (I usually read several books at the same time) - everything was gone! An empty Kindle!!!I am deeply disappointed and angry with the situation and feel utterly helpless in resolving this problem. My account was canceled without explanation, I cannot ask questions through the app's customer service as my account is closed, Amazon support has ceased responding to my emails, my Kindle books have been deleted, and there is no one who seems to care or can offer assistance in any way to address this issue.",2024,03,February,2024,2.0,1.0,low

2130,US,Amazon's Seller Policies Facilitate Fraud and Exploit Sellers,"As a seller on Amazon's platform, I must express my utter disappointment and frustration with their blatant disregard for the well-being of their sellers. It's evident that Amazon prioritizes profit over the integrity of its marketplace, as they consistently side with consumers even in cases of obvious fraud, leaving sellers to bear the brunt of the consequences.One of the most egregious issues plaguing Amazon's marketplace is their lenient approach towards fraudulent claims made by customers. Despite ample evidence proving that customers have received the items they ordered, Amazon readily refunds them at the expense of the sellers. This not only results in financial losses for sellers but also creates an environment ripe for exploitation.The fact that Amazon retains the fees they charge sellers, even in cases of fraudulent refunds, highlights their complete lack of accountability. Sellers invest their time, resources, and efforts into the platform, only to be met with indifference and exploitation by Amazon.Unlike on my own website, where stringent policies deter fraudulent activities, Amazon's lax approach enables customers to exploit the system with impunity. The frequency of such occurrences is alarming and severely undermines the profitability of selling on Amazon.It's evident that Amazon's policies are designed to prioritize market share over the well-being of sellers. Their relentless pursuit of dominance in the e-commerce industry has led them to sacrifice the livelihoods of countless sellers in the process. It's high time that sellers unite and hold Amazon accountable for their unethical practices.In conclusion, Amazon's facilitation of fraud and exploitation of sellers is unacceptable. Their policies not only undermine the integrity of the marketplace but also pose a significant threat to the livelihoods of sellers. It's imperative that sellers take a stand against such injustice and demand accountability from Amazon.",2024,03,March,2024,7.0,1.0,low

In the email he stated he agreed to what I had claimed.  And I gave the lawyer permission to cut the check by email.

Christina is the person handling the case.On a rainy day, an Amazon driver attempted to back out of my driveway, skidding down and running over my mailbox.  The van got stuck on the mailbox post, and a tow truck was called to pull out the van.  The damage to the lawn and the mailbox is well documented in video and photos, which ARC received.  Most recently, ARC stated that since I had filed for lawn damage 3 years ago, this is a repeat claim.   And demands that I submit a photo of the lawn repair from three years ago because the present lawn damage may be a replicated claim.  And I quote Christina from ARC representing Amazon.com.   ""As for the previous damages and showing the repairs, this is a new policy that has been put in place. Unfortunately this alerts us to people who have filed multiple times for damages.""  My argument is when new damages are inflicted by Amazon drivers,  Amazon should pay for damages no matter when it occurs.  When I sent her the email from three years ago, which never mentioned a photo she was using to reject the claim, she stated that she would look into it.  It is impossible to produce a photo from three years ago that was not taken or requested.  It is such a nonsense to reject a claim.  And Christina will ignore me until I bug her again; this has been going on for over THREE months!    It is utterly surprising that Amazon has resorted to this kind of CUSTOMER UNFRIENDLY practice.  Amazon.com is NOT a customer-friendly company!  I will file a claim with the small claims court.  I am so disappointed at how awful Amazon has turned out.

Nope!Instead, amazon insist that I report the matter to the local police to get a Crime reference and a crime report.The police provide the Crime reference but will only give the crime report to amazon but amazon insist that I need to get the report to them.So now I am playing-piggy-in-the-middle, with the police saying they will only talk to amazon and amazon wanting me to get the crime report to them and refusing to talk to the police.Meanwhile, I am £550 out of pocket!  And amazon call themselves the most Customer centric business on the planet!UPDATE:After wasting half a day with email exchanges between myself and amazon or myself and the police, every email to amazon gets the same response: We couldn't verify the details of the Crime Reference you provided.So the Crime ref provided by the police is not good enough for amazon and ""Therefore, we're unable to assist you any further in this matter. We would ask you to resolve the issues and reshare the Crime Reference with us"".So the police have issued the Crime reference but amazon do not like it so the process stops and there is nothing I can do.I have had 7 phone conversations with amazon and it is like talking to a wall.

Lately that's totally ignored by the drivers and tonight the driver left 4 big boxes outside the gate and my wife was able to catch him getting into his truck and he just ignored her and ran away. We order lots from Amazon and don't want it stolen and also I'm 80 years old and home today from another medical procedure so would be nice to have our delivery request honored and not ignored by these lazy drivers. The following are the order numbers which were left at the gate with the explicit sign to deliver everything to the front door.111-4651581-4353842, 111-4651581-4353842,113-7714709-5873865, 111-4651581-4353842Because of our age we rely on these deliveries so don't want them stolen!Finally we did get the dresser delivered with one of the drawers broken. Drivers who were from Wayfair as they wore Wayfair shirts and drove a Wayfair truck we noted to them the broken drawer and did not sign for the delivery. The driver stated he would notify Wayfair and that they'd send someone to fix the drawer or replace the dresser. Next we find out the driver most likely told Wayfair nothing and we were billed full tilt for the dresser. So the battle now going on 3 months goes on and what more can I say but I would never buy from Wayfair again and hope others that might, would read this saga and do the same not ordering from them.",2024,03,March,2024,57.0,1.0,low

2251,US,Terrible Seller and Customer Service Experience ,"I have been an Amazon customer for 15 years but unfortunately I will not be renewing my Prime membership or ordering from Amazon anymore. I had ordered a computer and was sent the wrong computer. I sent it back and did get my refund right  away. I ordered another computer from a different seller and was sent the wrong computer once again. I received an approval from the seller immediatly to return it, so I returned it immediately. This particular seller decided to not issue a refund. I reached out to him and he was telling me how he is ""investigating"" it, even though he sent the wrong computer.  However, he used the ""investigation"" as an excuse to hold my money hostage for weeks. I really needed my money back as computers cost alot of money and I needed to buy another one since I had dropped and broken mine. I reached out to Amazon customer service and the customer service rep profusely apologized and said they would submit the prime A-Z guarantee ticket and also give me a $10 gift certificate credit to my Amazon account for my troubles. I was pleased about this and was immediately sent a survey in which I gave raving reviews of the customer service I had just received. However, as time passed,  I hadn't heard a word nor did I receive any confirmation email and also didn't see any $10 gift card credit. I had to take time out to reach customer service again and the new agent said, I'm so sorry the agent before me never submitted the ticket for refund request and did not give you the $10 credit. I couldn't believe it and wondered what kind of customer service is this? So this new rep and me went back and forward with a bunch of bs they were telling me that this computer  isn't covered with A-Z guarantee and there is nothing they can do. I reminded the agent it WAS listed as Prime and they are incorrect and then I started asking what is wrong with Amazon sellers and customer service at Amazon? I told this agent I have witnessed some of the sellers and customer service going downhill fast. I asked them if Amazon is supporting their sellers stealing from their customers  even when they order a Prime listed product. All of a sudden it was a miracle as the rep decided to issue my return. I asked him, how about issuing me the $10 credit also. This rep said, oh yes, of course, but it will take at least a couple hours to register in your account. At this point, it was no surprise that I never have received the $10 gift card credit nor any notice about it even being initiated. Needless to say, I am bewildered. I decided to get a Costco membership the next day and have already found replacements for many things I've ordered over the years with Amazon and set up to have my account not renew my Prime membership in April. Something is seriously wrong at Amazon now and they lost me as a customer.  I have ordered thousands of dollars each year for many years. Here is a statement from Jeff Bezos I found on the Internet. “We have always wanted to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company.  We won’t change that. It’s what got us here.  But I am committing us to an addition.  We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work.”  My question to Jeff is....what kind of ""addition""  have you established in the workplace that allows shady sellers and awful customer service? I looked online and found a bunch of complaints about the seller who people are saying is an outright thief. It took me two minutes to run the company name and find this information. It took me to long to figure out how to see the actual Amazon seller reviews on which seems like it is hidden it's so hard to find now.

A few days later the courier delivered to the wrong address well, according to the photo of the 'proof of delivery' we were able to prove that it was not our address and house and of course it was refund done. A few weeks later we tried to order again exactly the same and guess what, the same again! This time he got a ""suspicious activity warning"" warning on my son's account and I tried to speak to customer service to confirm it wasn't his fault! A few months later he ordered 'headphones' which cost around £100 so guess what, same thing happened again!!! We were at home and no delivery only an email that you received the parcel...?! I called again and told the situation that we did not receive the shipment, I have security camera footage and can send proof that the courier was not at my place at the time. He said wait a few days and maybe the courier will deliver because sometimes the system mistakenly says delivered but they are still on their way. So we waited and called again after a few days. They advised to check the neighbors and come back in 48 hours. After a few days we called again... they said that will investigate and report back. After that call... a few days later my son's account was suspended due to an investigation. Tried to contact again and called like 10 more times trying to figure out what's going on here....asked for a photo of ""Proof of Delivery""....but (still haven't received it yet) ...so they shut down completely account and did not refund because their courier said the package was delivered safely to the location. today I spoke to an amazon ""manager"" who did not help me at all...couldn't give a ''Proof Of Delivery''...and no one can help because the courier said the item was delivered to the address and she can't change anything. The advice was from her... to contact the police...... So my son was left without money and without headphones. Therefore, dear future customers of Amazon....be careful...because if the courier steals from you...amazon will do nothing and you will be left without money and goods...and nothing to prove that it is not your fault.

Amazon refused to step in and resolve the situation themselves, even after it was clear the package was lost.

So I'm here waiting and waiting with the expenses rising for the funeral but yet no money back from amazon. I called back on the 14th Feb only to be told that I have to wait till 17th February for my refund that should have come bk to me fr the 3rd Feb. Tell me how this is right, how can you write a email stating one thing and then do the complete opposite. This is wrong beyond any measure. I am grieving a loss in the most horrible way ever. My big sister was murdered and amazon has made the journey of saying good bye to her even worst. I would never ever use them for important things because right now I am short of money and the products I bought from amazon when I have an email from 3rd of February telling me my money was being processed back into my account.

2460,US,Amazon -- when you absolutely need it next month,"I ordered a rollator walker for my 91-year old mother on 2/5/24. I was promised delivery by 9 p.m. 2/6/24. At about noon on 2/6/24 I went to track shipment and saw that the delivery date was now changed to 2/27/24 by 9 p.m -- even though it was picked up from a carrier facility 7 miles from the delivery address. I was back and forth with customer service chat who didn't want to tell me why it would be an extra day to deliver an item 7 miles away. They deflected and gave me UPS's number. UPS told me that it told Amazon last night that it wouldn't be able to deliver it today.Meanwhile, Amazon stopped the chat while I was holding with UPS and I had to start again. For a $250 item they wanted to offer me a $10 gift card. Then they offered instead a month off my prime membership -- and cut off the chat again. I called customer service but apparently they said they were the promotion department. They said as a gift and an apology they'd offer me a $100 voucher but I would have to pay for the shipping and handling. I pointed out that it's not a gift if I have to pay shipping and handling. The rep said he wasn't charging for the voucher just the shipping and handling. I told him that's not the way to treat a loyal prime customer. He kept saying ""OK you're not interested"" and I said that wasn't true I just didn't feel I should have to pay shipping and handling. He hung up on me.I called again and got through to customer service and he said he couldn't give any compensation, then said he could give $5. I told him that I had saved the previous chats and I was offered a month of free membership (about $12). He said Amazon can't do that which I know isn't true. I asked for an email address to send the chat and he wouldn't give me an email address. He then hung up.This is Amazon's idea of customer service.

Not only the drivers will drop the parcel at the door without even considering ringing the door-bell (if the parcel is to large to go through the letter-box) regardless to the weather condition. They use to be careful about delivering the parcels but no anymore!! It could be a result of work pressure and delivery quota per driver. Our house is located on the corner of two roads with a front garden leading to the front door via our drive. Last Friday 02nd Feb we were expecting a delivery of a new air-fryer as notified by AMAZON. We were sitting watching TV at lounge which by the front door at around four o'clock in the afternoon when I received an e-mail  from AMAZON stating the the package was delivered and left by the front door (with a photo showing that), so immediately we open the door but found nothing!!!! We looked everywhere around the house in case the driver decided to hide the package but there was nothing!! It is unusal for our neighbours to pick anything from the front of our door unless we were on a holiday and have requested them to do so! Our neighbourhood where we live, is very safe and never encountered nor heard of any theft! Furthermore, It needed someone there and ready for the delivery to be dropped so that he/she swiftly grab  it and run with it which is remotely to happen. Unless, the driver took the photo and picked it up again and took it. No one would've  suspected that action as it would look as if he was returning the item back to the van!! Even if we caught him doing it, he could easily say I didn't want to leave it at the door!!  Both our cars where there on the drive and our door-bell is working!!!!!!! So, we called AMAZON who initially integrated us asking if we are sure is not there, or with neighbours ..etc before telling us that we need to wait 72 hours before we can report it undelivered. So, we waited until Monday 05th and we requested a call-back where we discussed the issue!! Regrettably, the customer-service agent who was based in Ireland could not get through to the correct department who could resolve the issue and told us that she will leave a message on the system for them to call us back and assured us that the case will be resolved. No call was received so today (Tue 06th) once again requested a call back and we spoken to another agent based in Ireland who passed us to another colleague (sounded as if based in India) and who also passed us to another of his colleagues there who told us that they 72 hours  to investigate the matter and we have to wait!!

Even one of their colleagues told me they were wrong, when I quoted the promises. Today, I talked with one supervisor, and the only thing she provided is that I would receive my refund once they receive the item because the item has high value.  I think at some point I will receive my money, but I don't think my case is acceptable to every customer. I don't even have a chance to see the item, so if it was damaged it is not my fault. What is the reason to hold my money for so long? If their employees could consider my case with common sense, they could do more than just generic, useless instruction, as a machine.

Instead of resolving my issue, they passed me from one department to another, each time repeating the same tiresome process of explaining my problem from scratch.And let's not forget about the wait times. I could have watched the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy twice over while waiting for a response. It's almost as if they take pleasure in making you wait endlessly, dangling the hope of resolution like a carrot on a stick.To top it all off, when a resolution was finally offered, it was so inadequate that I might as well have been talking to a brick wall.

2494,US,Too Big To Care,"Here's the thing about mega huge companies that service consumers: They don't need to care about you. If a company has many millions of customers, and 90% of those customers escape doing business with amazon without issues, then the company has little to worry about.If amazon is making enough to send rockets into space, build their own warehouses, and buy their own delivery vehicles, they just don't need to care.I've been using amazon for decades and I suspect my recent issues have to do with policies enacted specifically to increase revenues.A few years ago I got locked out of my amazon account and customer service was no help. I pleaded with them to allow me SOME way to prove my identity beyond their asinine ""tell us the last 3 things you ordered."" At that point, I hadn't used my account in 3 months so I just did not remember the last 3 things I ordered, AND, amazon had at that point stopped showing orders on order confirmation emails. Instead, confirmation emails were only giving a link back to your amazon order page. Useless if you're locked out of your account. I did ultimately realize a way to get back into the account on my own.Most recently, while traveling, I ordered some items from different sellers, but items fulfilled by amazon to be delivered to an amazon locker. I waited, and then checked the amazon order page which showed that ALL the items were cancelled. I called amazon customer service but they knew absolutely nothing, so I reordered those items and waited again. A week later, I checked the amazon order page and yet again, all items were cancelled. This time, I insisted on talking to someone above the first person I spoke to. Then, they ended up handing me off to an actual American who worked specifically with the lockers, but that person just listened to my complaint and then said they'd tell someone else, blah, blah, blah. For some reason the UPS driver was cancelling my orders and nobody would tell me why. When I went to make the order a third time, I saw on the order page, for the first time, in red text, that the locker I had chosen was full. Mystery solved, no thanks to amazon, because they obviously have a low cost deal with UPS to deliver packages to their amazon lockers and the deal does not include bringing undeliverable items to a UPS facility so a customer can pick stuff up there. Instead, the driver just cancels the order and everything gets returned to amazon fulfillment centers with zero notification to the customer. My other major issue with amazon is that they did away with commenting on reviews for products. This was a super valuable method of sharing information with other consumers who took the time to write reviews. I suspect they stopped allowing this because people occasionally were recommending different products and that was obviously not good for them. Amazon has gotten progressively more and more antagonistic towards consumers but they know they can because there just is no alternative for us.",2024,02,February,2024,12.0,1.0,low

2496,US,DO NOT use Visa debit gift cards - AMAZON's system steals your money!,"Amazon received two $100 Visa debit gift cards from me - these were referral rewards from my health sharing program. The first I loaded per online instructions as a debit card, and it looked fine, for a day. I then loaded the second Visa debit gift card, but it loaded as $89.12 instead of $100. Got on chat and went through 3 people until one of them said something like ""Okay, I'm adding $11, plus a $10 courtesy for your trouble."" It was apparently a glitch in the system. The Visa debit was showing as $100.12 on the order. I then ordered a vacuum cleaner, putting the balance on my CC. TODAY my account now says ""We couldn't charge your selected payment method, so we charged your backup payment method."" They charged my CC $100. This is not cool. I am doubly paying the $100 for the vacuum. Back to the first Visa debit card, which I loaded and had appeared as a gift card with $100 in the system. I received an email on 01/31/2024 that said I had successfully loaded it, and they gave an $8 bonus for the load. Great! Problem is, it was zeroed out quickly, and when I went through the chat, one guy told me the amount would be reloaded within 24-48 hours. I then got an email saying that the payment failed. Of course it failed! They already got it from the card balance!Back to chat the morning of 02/02. They sent me to a phone person immediately, a lady named T. She was SO rude, as we had a lag, and she insisted on schooling me about how there was now no lag and so forth. T. was completely condescending. Needs education about tech and how to treat customers with respect. She  finally told me that the first thing people usually do is call the issuing bank. I am not in the habit of using Visa debit gift cards, and did not know that. She treated me like a child. I called the bank and they were completely helpful, giving me two transaction numbers when Amazon transferred funds into their system. But this is for Visa Debit GC #1. Who knows if it will work? I still have to try to claw $ back from them for the vacuum cleaner purchase with Visa debit #2. This has already cost me 2 hours of work. SO frustrated.The upshot - DON'T trust Amazon to deal with these debit gift cards. Their system will steal your money. Their Customer Service is quite ineffective and apparently doesn't work for this issue. They should be set up to not receive them at all, since it's so screwed up.I will edit this post after my next contact with Amazon Customer Service.",2024,02,January,2024,9.0,1.0,low

What happened next was disappointing:My item went missing for 10 days without a notification from the seller - who had shipped it - or Amazon PRIME - who had lost it! Reaching out to Amazon online, I asked what had happened to my purchase. Having been compelled to call Amazon, after a long wait, I opted for a call back. A very nice lady offered me a full refund. FYI, this option was not displayed to me online. ""Great ! thanks, yes please. Let's do that"". Guess what happened next? She sends the money back into my credit card account  and withing a couple of hours of it happily resting in my account - don't I get an email next day saying the product was being delivered!  It arrives; I print the RETURNS LABELS and stick them to the unopened box. Then I noticed that the Package required a STAMP, which turned out to be €9.00 So I found myself being put in a position of PAYING for accepting a NO OBLIGATION FREE TRAIL OF AMAZON PRIME 24-48 HOUR SHIPPING - should I RETURN a refunded order.

Here's what happened here and hoping these fools get exposed for what they are doing there and Bezos gets his head out of his butt and takes a further and strong look as to how his operation is being run there and whom he's hiring as customer service staff there, aka cheap labor from third world countries who can barely speak English or be able to formulate a sentence properly...here is what happened to me recently...I would like to voice a complaint against the biggest online retailer in the world, that being Amazon.com. So in a nutshell this past week, I ordered a Coke Zero mini fridge they were selling and there are two different designs to them, one has a bottle on it and the other has a full logo splurged horizontally across the door, and thinking I was finally going to receive the bottled version after two other attempts at getting this resulted in returning them both back for full refunds, a few leadership team members had promised and assured me I would finally be receiving the item that is pictured and when I received the item late last night at home (1/20/2024), I received yet the same item I received the other two times over and now having to return that as well. I have been in constant battles with their inept & incompetent customer service division & I have requested to speak to higher ups there to rectify this problem, but they have done nothing but lead me astray like a puppy dog, ignoring my requests and then accusing me of lying to them that I actually received the correct item when I did not & I showed them the two links in question, side to side and pinpointed this in as many ways as possible, but still, they refuse to do anything to help me out and I have just about had it with them. I truly feel they are practicing fraudulent and deceptive advertising at that website and I am at my wits end with them to boot! I do not appreciate being accused of something I didn't even do here and I could care less whether promotional credit was used or not on this item to cover said costs of the product, it was still the wrong item shipped out to me and nothing has been done to rectify this mess. I submitted further proof & evidence as they had requested to show them I was not making any of this stuff up and I never heard back from them, so I re-contacted them to no avail, so hoping this situation gets remedied this once & for all! They're oblivious to never wanting to admit they were at fault for anything but rather, blame the customers and now they're asking for solid proof too?! Well, they got it as this kind of chicanery needs to cease right here and now!All this over a mini fridge they're selling that has two different logos to it and when you order it from them, what is displayed versus what one actually does receive are literally quite different in so many ways and aspects, as it's beyond comprehension with them. Just a sad excuse for an organization to be doing any of this to their loyal and faithful customers.UPDATE on 1/23/2024 at 2 PM CT...Well, I have to give them credit where credit is due as it took a major interaction with their corporate team and CEO to get to the bottom of this craziness and I am happy to report that they came through with fixing this messed up and screwed up order and they even offered humblest apologies for accusing me of lying about everything associated with that order and what I received and such. I still would be very cautious about doing business with them, no matter how well known they are as their customer service division really needs a huge and major overall and to bring in people who can actually speak the English language properly and truly give a damn about helping their customers who keep that business afloat on a daily basis. Serious re-training of their staff needs to be done at once as they all seem in quite a bit of a hurry to conclude chat and phone conversations without properly delving into the key issues one might have with their orders. I'll change my rating to a 4 star review from one as they acted appropriately but again, thank goodness for getting in touch with their corporate division and CEO or I'd still be having issues with getting this nonsense solved to this very day, but it's now done and completed and let's hope they don't screw up any more of my orders from here on out.

Upon unwrapping the book an entire section in one piece of 65 PAGES fell out of the book onto my lap. Now both the seller and Amazon are refusing a partial refund (for book) cassettes are good.

How does a Senior without a printer, return an Item ? Where does a person go to get a LABEL printed ? Someone told me the Library, how does this work when the instructions are on my laptop ? l know l am looking for an EXCEPTION due to my AGE, which will probably not be recognized by either Amazon or Prime...For all the times l would use a printer, it is not feasible for me to buy one !!! l am looking for suggestions as there is no reason for me to keep the item in question...(DOESN""T FIT ME EITHER)..l will most certainly have to consider my online shopping with Amazon or Prime in the Future.. It was a convenient way for me to shop, due to my advanced age & capability of getting around physically...There are other companies for me to shop at, but l have had issues returning things to WISH, LITE INTHEBOX too far away in China, only once or twice but until NOW felt quite satisfied with both Amazon & Prime...Will never feel the same about ONLINE SHOPPING...",2024,01,January,2024,7.0,1.0,low

2736,GB,They're so bad it's hard to know where to start,"It's hard to know where to start because there is now so much wrong with this company's services.Having been an Amazon Prime customer for well over a decade I have seen a lot of changes but recently the service has gone downhill to the point that I will not be renewing my subscription when it next expires.Particular issues that I've experiences are:1. Fake products - There are now a large number of cheap/dangerous knockoff products on amazon and it is impossible to tell from the listings which are genuine and which are the fakes.2. Reviews - The review system is broken and now so full of fake and even fraudulent reviews it has lost all meaning. Basic tricks like aggregating reviews for several products or even switching reviews over to a completely different product are common and no attempt seems to be made to stop this practice.3. Prime Delivery - This increased significantly in price and whereas once next day delivery was the norm, the minimum I am now quoted is 3 to 5 days with most items not even despatching for a couple of days after the order - as bad as the free delivery for non-prime members. It is not unusual for items to take two to three weeks to arrive despite paying the Prime premium.I am also seeing a lot of instances where the item goes to ""collected by courier"" status very quickly preventing order cancellation but no further movement or valid training information appears for several days suggesting that the item has probably not actually been despatched and that status change was just to stop me cancelling when I discover the delay.4. Prime Video - This was always a bit of a rip-off with most items incurring an extra charge on top of prime membership but the latest change forces you to pay an extra subscription on top of the already expensive Prime membership to get the add free viewing I got for free up until now.5. Prime music - this is another service that has been deliberately made almost unusable unless you want to pay yet another addition subscription on top.6. Customer services - All contact is via chat or phone, not email, so hard to make formal complaints or keep a paper trail. Although occasionally helpful, most of the time they merely read information to you that you can already see on the website and promises of action are rarely followed through.I have, at one point or another raised all of these issues with Amazon customer services only to be met with responses that ranged from complete indifference to promises to pass on my concerns which clearly went no further because nothing changed.In short, other than the convenience of having so many items in one place there is little to commend this company any more.

Finally she sent me to her supervisor who assured me that the instructions were properly set up.The first delivery was wrong and I went through the same phone conversations again, only to have the second delivery not delivered in the box again.Trying to figure out how to get Amazon to get this done is seemingly impossible.Although I saw a story recently about Bezos calling his own customer service , he obviously was pleased with what he found judging by the result.

2746,GB,Too high on their own hubris.,"When I signed up for prime, parcels got delivered on time and usually with a reliable delivery slot. Then, over time,  the delivery time occasionally changed to 'Today by 10PM'. Fair enough, sometimes things go wrong. But then this happened again and again to the point where it became standard practice. I don't work for Amazon and I didn't pay for Prime so that I could wait around for eight to ten hours a day until they could deign to provide the service I was paying them for. When I phoned up at 3pm on a friday (the same day as posting this review) to complain about it regarding an order which was marked as 'Out for delivery' since 9AM, instead of solving the problem, the agent on the phone said that ""actually, that's in a queue and might not be there until Sunday"". If that was the case, why was it showing as 'Out for delivery'? This combined with the reduction in selections to the point of being really quite pathetic on Amazon Fresh, and raising prices to cover the amount of money they have wasted on Prime Video just makes the company as a whole both complacent and arrogant to the point where they no longer deserve anybody's business. In fact, it got to the point where just dealing with Amazon literally just felt like being in an abusive relationship, which is why I cancelled my subscription. There is a popular phrase: 'fluff' around and find out.Amazon do the 'fluffing' around. Their customers do the finding out.",2024,01,January,2024,6.0,1.0,low

2756,GB,Breach of the Data Protection Act 2018 - Theft of Intellectual Property,"I’ve written to Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy and his Executive Relations team on numerous occasions about Amazon’s breach of the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA) and theft of its customer’s intellectual property.  I stated in an e-mail to Mr Jassy, among other things, that I’m complaining about Amazon’s unlawful delivery policy.Amazon UK Services Limited (Amazon) continues to breach the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA) and is deliberately intruding on its customer's privacy and stealing their intellectual property by taking photos/images of their person and of their private property (location) without their express permission and Amazon is not transparent with how its processing, sharing and storing such data and is exacerbating its misconduct resorting to evasive tactics to avoid the issue, which is totally unacceptable.As far as I’m aware the conditions of purchase on all of my orders thus far, DID NOT include me having to give up my rights and allow Amazon to violate my privacy and take my intellectual property in exchange for delivering my parcels. If that were the case, I would certainly not have bought anything from Amazon. Amazon's fulfillment of contract is to simply deliver the parcels and ask for the recipient's name and signature which is legally sufficient for proof of delivery and which I would oblige if the drivers presented me with that option, but they don’t. They quickly snap a photo of you as soon as you open the door, drop the parcel off and walk away, even despite the large security notice on my front door clearly stating, ""THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY, NO PHOTOS OR VIDEOS ALLOWED!""It is clear that Amazon needs to urgently address its delivery policy and give customers an option to sign for their deliveries and it must train its drivers to understand and respect PRIVATE PROPERTY and the right of privacy.Below, are some of the evasive tactics that Mr Jassy and team have responded following my Complaint and Request for “Right of Erasure” (SARs)[OPEN Quote] This is Jassy with Amazon's Executive Relations team.By corresponding with me, you have reached the highest level of customer service within our company. The Executive Relations' Department is the most senior department to which an issue may be escalated within Amazon.co.uk. This department liaises with customers on behalf of Amazon's most senior business executives, including the Amazon.co.uk Managing Director, the Amazon.co.uk Director of Customer Service, and our CEO.Your request was sent from an email address that is different from the one we have on file for you. I realise that you're concerned about deleting the photos or videos. It's never our intention to prolong this process, but in order to protect your privacy we can only send account information to the email address associated with your account. Please send this request from that email address.[END QUOTE]So according to his request I sent Mr Jassy my Complaint via the email associated with my Amazon account and this is the slippery response I received:[OPEN QUOTE]  “Hello,This is Gaurab with Amazon Executive Relations.I'm sorry but I couldn't find an Amazon.co.uk account under the e-mail address from which you've written.[END QUOTE]Consequently, I sent Mr Jassy and team step-by-step screenshots of me logging into my Amazon account via the email associated with my account which Gaurab above claimed s/he could not find and this is the evasive response I received on that attempt:[OPEN QUOTE] Dear Nicola,This is with Amazon's Executive Relations team.I was hoping to speak with you directly, on the number listed on your account, but unfortunately I was unable to reach you nor leave a voice message confirming my call.I hope you’ll first accept my apologies for the frustration and inconvenience you’ve experienced. [END QUOTE]These are many such examples of Amazon’s evasive tactics.I still haven’t received a satisfactory response from Amazon and as a result, I have no knowledge of how my personal data, photos/images are being processed, shared and stored as Amazon continues to arrogantly breach the Data Protection Act 2018.",2024,01,January,2024,3.0,1.0,low

I mean I seriously do believe that whoever is hiring such incompetent people have literally went blindly into the night snatching whomever throwing them into a giant room with phones and computers and saying get to work. Managers, supervisor's, Representatives all that work there or at least 97 % aren't paddling with both ores in the water.  It's like someone shot the dots of their dice years ago. I'm a nice person however when you pay for Amazon prime and then sometimes pay extra to have same day delivery, what that really means is haha we got cha again. Cause ya don't receive your package.  Amazon has adopted the moto you'll get it when we're damn good and ready to deliver it and if we want to will also use it and still send it. When you do get the notification that your package has been delivered, best believe their saying haha got cha again. Cause it's been delivered to the wrong place. Then you call, excuse me my package says delivered but it's not at my house. Umm excuse me sir have you checked the outside perimeter in the bushes also have you walked next door to check with your neighbors have you called other family members and have you walked up and down your street yelling has anyone seen my package.  Ummm excuse me Amazon Representatives last time I checked it wasn't my responsibility to track down something that I paid not only for you to deliver it but also I'm paying for prime as well plus the cost of whatever it is that I bought. You think you get just GPS it right the first time or maybe just do the job you applied for and got and getting paid to do. No instead you wanna scream threaten just get down right ignorant and hang up and then send a email asking for feedback on how great of a job you did with NOT helping me. I'm sorry but if your stupid enough to send me a email wanting feedback on your performance best believe I'm gonna take the time to fill it out. I'm absolutely sick and disgusted at the lack of respect as a customer I receive from Amazon customer support. I literally talk to Amazon more than my own family. Amazon has probably the worst customer service representatives in the world. I'd rather deal with being stalked by Michael Myers or having Ghostface call me and taunt me than pick up The phone and deal with a ignorant Amazon Representatives because the outcome is the same.

2797,GB,Appalling customer service.,Appalling customer service.I have purchased from Amazon many many times and never had an issue. This said however on 12 December I ordered a large item (a chair/bed) which is something I have not done before. I needed the chair/bed for a guest visit and ordered it on 10 December. I was initially happy with the fast delivery date which was due to be 14 December. However despite the fact that Amazon claim to have attempted delivery in 14 December this attempt definitely didn’t not happen (I have an advanced security system which I had reviewed) when the chair eventually arrived with no notice in 18 December on a dark wet and windy evening it was left by my gate in the rain until I could get help to lift the very heavy boxes inside. Once inside it took hours to put the chair together with the poor and hard to follow instructions. Once installed it was apparent that the chair was of very poor quality and defective. I immediately reported the matter to amazon who quite frankly have been totally unhelpful. They have basically explained the item is from a ‘third party seller’ which apparently means they don’t really care!! I have always believed that items bought on the Amazon platform gave me some kind of protection but this is definitely not the case. I am now still arguing with the ‘third party seller’ with no help from Amazon. I have been informed that the seller sees no problem with the chair which quite frankly is alarming in itself. I have been told I need to return the chair in the original packaging (which I don’t Have as it arrived wet and damaged) and pay for a courier to collect it !! I have since discovered that previous reviews of the same chair are much of the same .

It is a complete and utter waste of money. I will be throwing it away. So the question is do you care. I don't hold out much hope in your responding. My advice to people I think would be that if a company only cares about taking your money and doesn't want to take Care of your problem when it arises, then I can only think they are on the slippery slope down.

They may seem friendly with their interface and show convenience through services. It's all a facade.However, that's a totally different story when it comes to communication and treatment towards employees.Reviews on the site are sometimes fake with scammers acting as sellers while authentic opinions are being suppressed. I noticed the number of bots frequenting there as well. Also users/buyers can find their reviews being removed and discover themselves being banned from contributing for ""unusual reviewing activity"" by Amazon.  The moderators really have poor judgement behind their monitors. Another example is when employees that opperate in warehouses experience awful working conditions, the bosses there give the employees little time for a break. If you're an employee that have a problem, your boss is not going to show any mercy for your mental anguish.Pathetically enough, workers resorted in using pee-pee bottles if they need to urinate instead of going to the bathroom.Workers in that environment usually breakdown mentally and become severely exhausted. The most ludicrous resolve Amazon has to offer was coping spaces in 2021. These are mental health booths known as ""AmaZen.""In the Summer of 2023, Amazon decided to lock one of its customers, Brandon Jackson of Baltimore, Maryland, from his home connected with the smart home devices because a delivery driver allegedly heard a derogatory term through his doorbell. This has made news in my country.Apparently, no one was home at the time as evident and Amazon finally granted access to the man's residence and his accounts without explanation.I'm not going to deal with a business that tries to control its customers in an abusive manner.

2835,US,BUYER BEWARE,"BUYER BEWARE. As a Prime Member, Amazon did NOT make good on an order even though they didn't follow delivery instructions asked for at the time of order. As a result, and as a possible theft, Amazon did NOT provide a refund or replacement order even after completing every required step stated by reps. Beyond the financial loss, be aware most reps are hard to understand, don't listen, don't bother to refer to file notes (if there are any). They seem to use the same scripts not related to a question or to the information just provided. Example: I tried to explain the local police referred us to the Sheriff’s Office to file a possible theft report as they have the law enforcement jurisdiction at our rural address. No question or acknowledgement but repeatedly stating, “You must file a police report.” Finally, when I asked to speak to a supervisor, the rep hung up!  Also, as in my case, you will never speak to the same rep again. Even after your claim reportedly goes to “escalation,” you must call the general customer service number and start over, which includes reexplaining EVERYTHING as if it’s the first time you called.  Maddening! Still, I did EVERYTHING required, even repeatedly.  I was finally reassured by one phone rep that he saw my PDF report on file, that all had been done including talking to the USPS. He said our claim would be resolved quickly after he sent all to Escalation and not to worry about the deadline since we had completed everything required by that date. Yet on the “deadline date,” I called and spoke to 2 reps. I was told by the first rep after placing me on an extended hold, that he had called the police department and they had no record of a report from me on file, therefore there was nothing Amazon could do.  I again explained I had sent a PDF of a Sheriff’s Department report due to law enforcement jurisdiction as instructed by the local police department three times! He just repeated the same thing again with no acknowledgement of what I just said.  I begged him to listen and not hang up. I asked what ""police"" number he had called to verify he had called the Sheriff's Department; he said he couldn’t share that information due to privacy. I verbally stated the phone number of the Sheriff’s Department and asked if he had called that number - he wouldn't answer. I then asked to speak to his supervisor and was assured the supervisor would give me the same information he had. After an extended hold, someone new got on the phone. With a rude demeanor, he repeated that they had no police report on file; therefore, there would be no further support – refund or reorder. When I insisted it was there, again explaining that the jurisdiction was with the Sheriff’s office, he stated it did not contain all the information required. With witness at my side, I asked repeatedly for him to provide specifics of what was not included as I had referred to their email requirements, emailed those requirements to the Sheriff's Department, and saw the report with my own eyes, confirming all requirements met. He would not answer my question and provided no details. Finally, he said it was an “initial report” and not a “final report.” I told him this was the first I heard this as required to which he insisted they had provided me this information. Their email information had said to call Amazon during the police's office hours so their rep could verify information and I did this. (As soon as my call ended, I called the Sheriff’s Department myself and got immediately through. The gentleman in the report/records department told me no one from Amazon had called. They also said the rep doesn’t understand law enforcement investigations because if they don’t have a suspect as in my case, it is considered an open case with no final report written or available.) Bottomline: I have wasted significant time and effort – for nothing. I’ve taken a big financial loss on goods not delivered and paid at the same time a Prime Member fee to experience this type of treatment. (I also unfortunately ended up in the ER due to the stress of this all with heart issues.) Almost humorous, as you are on hold, Amazon’s recording speaks of their desire to have the best world class service. I am not a rude or unreasonable person. I used to be the Sr. V.P. in charge of customer service for a large company where we strived to protect the company but be fair with our customers. Trust me, Amazon's service is the worst. It’s inexcusable and I’m surprised there hasn’t been a class action lawsuit over inconsistent and unfair practices. Even if you’ve heard positive things about Amazon or you haven't had a problem yourself, just wait. Your turn may be coming.

This has happened a number of times with other orders.  I called Customer Service to get my lost items replaced, and I spoke with a rep who was nice and polite, but I simply could not understand what she was saying to me.  I had to ask her to repeat what she was saying many, many times, and when she did, I often still could not understand her.  I realize that providing overseas customer support has financial advantages for Amazon, but it is at the expense of customers.  On almost every customer service call I have made to Amazon, I have had a great deal of trouble communicating with the rep.  And I have often received information that is completely incorrect.  I remember when Customer Service reps were based in the U.S., and they were great and I was able to communicate with them.  My heart sinks every time I have to call Customer Service and I hear someone answer with a heavy accent because I know the interaction is going to be difficult and stressful.  I love  Amazon because of their huge and varied inventory and the ease of ordering from them, but I hate their Customer Service and Amazon delivery services.  Before Amazon created their own delivery service and delivery was handled by Fedex and UPS and a few others, I never had a problem with delivery.  But now I've had multiple problems, with my items being delivered to the wrong address (when my address is clearly posted on my house), with my items not being delivered at all but being ""lost,"" and with my items being delivered late.

Yes, you read that correctly. I paid for an empty box and then they will decide if they want to give me a refund! I know this sounds crazy because it is!!!

2889,US,I am so upset with amazon,"I am so upset with amazon. They have ruined a 13 year old girls Christmas.  I have been begging all day to get replacement products and it has been a no go. I don't have alot of money . I struggle but I always make sure to have enough when it comes to the children in my family. My niece made a wishlist so I tried to at least get her several things on there that I could afford. She is 13 and her hair is her everything her. so she wanted a product call Not Your Mother beach babe for curls and she also wanted brittany spears fantasy bodyspray, she loves brittany spears and is a huge fan. To many that's not costly but to me it is because I have numerous children to buy for that's in my family and it adds up. But anways I ordered these products the not your mother comes in, when I opened it the I noticed the plastic looked wet so I open the plastic and this oily stuff was coming out so I cleaned it up off my carpet and when I really looked  the bottles were empty and the lids were barly on. Ok the brittany spears body spray comes in, the lid was busted off and the spray thing did not work. So I call amazon I swallowed my pride and begged and begged for them to replace the products. I explained to them over and over it they were Christmas gufts for my niece. Basically I was told no because I didn't take a picture of the bottles leaking. Who in their right mind thinks of a camera when greasy product is leaking all over their carpet. Ok at that time I didn't know I had to take a picture, who would have known that. I have talked to numerous people on amazon everyone has something different to tell me. I'm very upset because I told them I don't want the money back I just want the products so she has a gift from me. They didn't even care. I cried I was so hurt because I have been a very loyal costumer, I have 4 services with them for the last 2 years. I don't have the words it's Christmas damnit!! I don't have no more to give. A multi billion dollar company couldn't replace 20 dollars worth of products whats wrong with that? It dont even sound normal. Shame on you people at amazon how do u sleep at night knowing you knew the products were damaged when u put them in the boxes.  The only one that will suffer in this is my niece, i guess she supose to open the lid on the body spray and dump it on herself. It's like she is to blame, I guess she is the one who put the damaged products in the boxes knowly they were damaged and gifts at that. I did it for my niece she don't have rich parents they struggle as well. What seems cheap to some may be expensive to another.  I'm sorry for the long review I just want people to know how a multibillion dollar company will take my money quick but at the Sametime won't make it right for the costumer when it was their own company that damaged the products. You should be ashamed of yourselves knowing you don't give a rats ass and that's what really upsets me. Also I want to add they said if they were to decide to give me my money it would be 30 days. Christmas is long gone after 30 days. I just wanted the products they can keep the money that how much this girl means to me. My heart is broke",2023,12,December,2023,1.0,1.0,low

Suspicion arose when the weight felt off, and upon opening it, I discovered baby items instead of the expensive DJI camera bundle set I ordered. The disappointment prompted an immediate call to Amazon customer service, as evident in the attached photo.Despite the tracking indicating a delivery on my street for five hours on 21.12.23, the package mysteriously arrived on 22.12.23. During the redelivery, the delivery person, with limited English proficiency, placed the parcel on the floor and asked me to enter a code on his phone—raising further concerns about the legitimacy of the process.The evident scan became apparent when I noticed the packaging opened too easily, contrary to Amazon's usual tamper-proof measures. This ordeal is especially disheartening as I cannot have children, and the unexpected delivery of baby items shattered my Christmas spirit.

2903,GB,Amazon 'customer service' is abysmal.,"There is absolutely no reasonable way to contact Amazon to make a complaint about a blatant lie by one of their delivery drivers. So I'm putting the details here which is the only website that seems to allow me to do so. A note on my Amazon account, presumably from the Amazon delivery driver, says: ""Your package was delivered to a neighbour James at door H Signed by: James.""This is a blatant lie. This is a small block of 8 flats, and there is only one James in the block, and that would be me. The delivery driver is a liar. This is what actually happened.The package was left outside the main security doors where anyone passing by or visiting another tenant could easily have stolen it. Fortunately, it was noticed by a neighbour who brought it to my door. Whilst I had asked for the package to be delivered to my neighbour, I was at home all day. A simple push of either MY bell or my neighbour's, would have got an answer. Instead, the package was left outside the security doors at the front of the building and the driver who delivered it lied about it. As an aside, I ordered something else at the same time as the item above and it was supposed to arrive yesterday. I still haven't got it at the time of writing this review. I will never buy from Amazon again. IMO, the customer service is abysmal. The chatbox 'assistant' (I use the word advisedly) is ludicrous. You simply go round and round in circles and never get to make the comment/s you want to make in the first place.

When they did delivery guy decided not to show up and instead logged as ""customer didn't accept the item"" and returned it to Amazon. I called them filed a complaint about it. They investigated and returned with an e-mail that says ""you are right delivery guy did this on his own"". -I asked for replacement. They said there aren't any in stock. -I asked them to send the one which I couldn't even see. After all it was only carried by the delivery guy and its brand new. They said its not possible. Since it labeled as returned amazon sees that as used so they can't do that either.-Then I asked the refund which they already started without even asking me.-6 days past. no refund. I called them again. And the answer is I might have to wait up to a month on the top of this almost a month of waste of time. Because they need to investigate since the amount is bigger then 500 euro.So to summarise it: I have waited for almost a month for them to decide not to deliver.

I was missing one item. The one item missing that I ordered was an easy bake oven .I originally wanted to order from Walmart as it was cheaper ($59.97) but it was sold out everywhere but on Amazon it was $185.xx approx with some extra items food items for the easy bake oven but it was in stock.Other items in that box that I received,costed more than the easy bake oven.When I called Amazon to let them know that one item was not in the box but everything else was , they told me I had to file a police report.Which they believe it was stolen and I had to file a report .I don’t believe it was stolen , it was just not sent by Amazon . So I filed a Police report anyways cause Amazon won’t give me my money back to get a new one until I file a police report and to boot it’s now a week away from Christmas .I sent the incident number by email which I filed with the police department before 10am on Friday dec 15th,2023 and I also told the Amazon customer service rep that I would be calling back after work as I would like an update . When I called back after work the lovely lady listened to my story and tried to call the police department at that time but because it was after 6pm the police department was no longer open . They had since 10 am in the morning to call but no Amazon customer service rep called and now I have to wait over the weekend . Now, I have to  call back on Monday and go through the same process for a missing easy bake oven that I believe they never had or sent. Plus, I have to go and try and find another one somewhere over the weekend .Amazon packaging tape is so unbelievably hard to get off on any package , the package I received was in perfect condition and the whole box was on my porch. There was no question in my mind that the package was open or tampered with. Now, I have to go through all the extra work and stress for something that was never put in the package in the first place . If someone was going to steal anything would they not just take the entire box or pick the more expensive items in the box and wouldn’t the box be damaged ?????All good questions that three + managers at Amazon cannot answer or help with. They don’t have a picture of the package inside before it left Amazon but a picture of the package/box on my porch from the delivery personel , which looks exactly how it was when I received it .I will not be purchasing anymore from Amazon … I received all my products that were suppose to be in my package except for one item and I am the one that has to do all the work and file a police report for something I believe was not stolen . I believe Amazon didn’t sent it . Which is more suspicious is that Walmart was sold out everywhere in the GTA.

Truly, they have never let me down, deliver ALWAYS on time, keep me updated all the way too, and so easy if a return is needed.I see our Amazon drivers every day struggling in this constant traffic, literally stood still at times on motorways and peak time, and yet they still raise a smile, and deliver all the goods to the correct place even following any instructions for safe places.This Christmas 2023, (at the time of the review), they will be busier than ever, and yet they still deliver, even up to 10pm at night.

It should have been delivered to me on 26th November, though instead I was delivered a box of opened dry cat food.

I asked I be sent an actual IPad Air, though was told I could only be refunded the money, and only once Amazon had “received my return” (the cat food).

In actual fact I’ve been treated worse than someone returning an unwanted book, as if it had been a low cost item that was being refunded I would have been reimbursed within 14 days, rather than it taking more than a month because of the financial cost involved. I have kept on being told to “be patient” and that I’ll be refunded in 5 to 10 days, though the date keeps being put back for no reason that anyone has explained, and now for some reason I won’t be refunded until 2024. It means my daughter will be without a Christmas present this year. No one at Amazon seems particularly bothered or sympathetic.I might continue to buy inexpensive items from Amazon that I can’t easily get elsewhere, though I certainly won’t be buying anything expensive from them again.

I have purchased electrical items (240v) which are unsafe, to the point they'll kill someone who's not vigilant or knowledgeable.  Example? One of many, I purchased some ceiling spots. The wiring inside was needle thin, definitely not capable of 240v at the usual 13A. This is a fire hazard.  Furthermore,  its a metal chassis and there was no grounding of the chassis! A literal death trap.Fourth reason:The returns and refund processes. They completely ignore uk consumer law and I've reported them to trading standards numerous times. They're always Claiming that because it's a seller's shop they don't refund! News Flash, my contract is with amazon who take my money and who appear on my back statements.  Amazon have a separate contract with their seller stores. What SHOULD  happen is that ANY refund should be made by amazon and if its from a seller's shop, amazon claim that back from them.Fifth reason:Customer service.  Well lack of. Trying to contact them is a mission.  They're making it harder and harder to reach an actual human! Then when you do get through,  clearly indian call centre agents with fake names follow a standard,  generic script which in no way is relevant to a customer's specific issue.Sixth Reason:No refund without a return.  Example? I ordered a box of paper clips. It was poorly packaged and had split during transit.  There was a trail from my drive to the front door.  It was a wet day, so even when i cleaned them up, they couldn't be used.  I contacted customer service to explain and they said ""without a return we cannot refund "". What absolute nonsense. Seventh reason:Delivery and drivers.  I'm easy to find but i leave good instructions.  They always deliver to the wrongbplace. On the of chance they get it right, they leave gates open, don't knock on the door and they always lie saying ""handed to customer "" when you're lucky if you even see the van arrive or leave. Eighth reason:Amazon Prime TV. There's nothing worth watching anymore.  If you find one or 2 things they've started making additional charges and the amount of ads is beyond ridiculous and Furthermore they have no 4k or uhd content. *please note, the date stat3d is just one example of many*",2023,12,April,2023,16.0,1.0,low

Both the app and website told me my item was in the Amazon Georgia facility. ￼As the Delivery days would come and go I would then reach out to Customer Support at Amazon. Customer Support would say to me here’s a new delivery date and if it doesn’t come by this date we can offer you a refund. I would tell them each time I don’t want a refund, I want my product.￼I believe I called at least three times because the date slipped three times. By the third time I was pretty miffed and I asked it to be escalated to the management in customer service that I did not want a refund I want in my product the product that was basically still being offered as in stock even but all they kept saying was, we can give you a refund.So I get escalated to the manager and the manager says we can offer you a refund and nothing else. I said I’d like this escalated out of their customer service then and I was told no.￼I was told I could be issued a refund and re-order the item which is now more expensive or hang up that was it no other solution it was not gonna get escalated out of the customer service area for items are being offered as for sale items are purchasable items are getting stuck at Amazon and then Amazon is not making good with the process of delivery To make matters worse, is paying hush money to every customer that goes through this in the form of the refund. Amazon does not escalate any issues in his own company or if items are getting stolen having those escalated either they just pay off the customers with refunds ￼I didn’t ask for a refund I didn’t want a refund. I wanted the item that they had put on the website as for sale and that I purchased. Customer Support Management gave me the take it or leave it option and refused to escalate the fraud or inside the company, theft of the item.I would bet that Amazon uses this refund workflow to as I said silence the customer with hush money, but also not really reporting it appropriately potentially on the books because if they have excellent amount of sales, I can guarantee daily they have X amount of refunds that are you know just going and no one’s doing anything about it so they’re just Sending in the outdoor and out the indoor.Customer should not be getting refunds from Amazon.

Going through two different people, giving the same information twice, verifying via email my name twice, I was finally directed to a ""specialist."" She asked question after question, had an accent I could barely understand, and it sounded like 50 people were chattering in a foreign language in the same room. Perversely, I didn't hang up--I wanted to see how long the ""process"" took. I carried my phone with me while I worked on other tasks in my home. Well, 40 minutes later, she told me I'd get a credit on my credit card ""within 3-5 days"" later.Shame on me for daring to do business with Amazon again.

3155,US,"Amazon customer service manipulating, gaslighting, double speaking, terrible was not enough to describe","I am writing this review to share a recent experience with Amazon that has left me deeply disappointed and concerned. After purchasing a Panasonic camera, I discovered that it was missing an essential component - the battery charger. This led me to contact Amazon's customer service, where I expected a simple and straightforward resolution. However, what transpired was far from satisfactory.My interaction with a customer service manager named Cris, based in the Philippines, was not only unhelpful but also deeply troubling. Cris's approach to handling my concern was evasive and unprofessional. The situation escalated to a point where, following my expressed dissatisfaction, I received a notification about ""abnormal activity"" on my account, which I believe was a retaliatory action.This experience has raised serious concerns about the misuse of power within Amazon's customer service. The treatment I received was not just poor service; it bordered on tactics I would associate with organized crime - using intimidation and authority to suppress and control. As a customer of over 18 years, I am shocked and appalled.I believe such behavior within Amazon's ranks is unacceptable and poses a significant risk to customer trust and loyalty. I urge Amazon to address this issue seriously and take necessary steps to ensure that no other customer experiences such treatment. Until then, my confidence in Amazon and my decision to continue as a customer remains uncertain.",2023,12,November,2023,4.0,1.0,low

3226,GB,Bad sales stunt by Amazon,"**Title: Deceptive Sales Stunt - An Unfulfilled Promise**I recently had the unfortunate experience of participating in what was advertised as an ""invite-only"" tele event on Amazon, and the entire ordeal has left me deeply dissatisfied. It's disheartening to realize that what was initially presented as an exciting opportunity turned out to be nothing more than a sales stunt, and the lack of transparency in this process is concerning.The concept of an exclusive tele event piqued my interest, and I eagerly engaged with the promotion in the hopes of securing an invite. Unfortunately, like many others, my anticipation turned into frustration as the promised invitations never materialized. It's hard not to feel misled when a company as prominent as Amazon engages in what seems to be a calculated marketing strategy that falls short of delivering on its promises.Transparency is the bedrock of trust between consumers and companies, and in this instance, Amazon's approach has left a lot to be desired. If the intention behind the promotion was to generate excitement and engagement, it backfired for a substantial number of participants who were left empty-handed and disillusioned.I believe that it's essential for a company of Amazon's stature to uphold a higher standard when it comes to marketing practices. Customers invest their time and enthusiasm in these promotions, and the least they deserve is clear communication and fulfillment of promises. This experience has undoubtedly left me questioning the integrity of Amazon's promotional activities.I sincerely hope that Amazon takes this feedback to heart and reevaluates its approach to such promotions in the future. Clear communication and a commitment to fulfilling promises will not only prevent customer disappointment but also contribute to a more positive and trusting relationship between Amazon and its customers.",2023,11,November,2023,71.0,1.0,low

3266,GB,Delivery,"Delivery - handed to resident, but not!Amazon UK's Logistics delivery is useless. Some people may find getting a delivery at 8.30pm convenient, I do not. Why do they leave it so late to start their deliveries?I have had several deliveries where in my orders it states ""parcel handed to resident"" but in all cases it was just left unattended at the front of my property. I assume management are instructing the drivers to leave the parcel no matter what.My tip - do not give Amazon permission to leave the parcel unattended in your amazon settings and/or delivery addresses. If the driver/Amazon choose to leave the parcel unattended then they are liable for the loss. If they do not give you a refund or send the item again you can do a chargeback against them via your card. If your order says ""parcel handed to resident"" and it wasn't ask them for picture proof of the parcel being handed to the resident.It is a shame I now have to do this with Amazon UK. Like someone else below has stated you can't either email/call to complain or leave feedback as they have removed the options from their site. I assume because they were getting to many complaints.

3268,US,Horrible Customer Service & Won't Refund Me For A 3 Month Old Return,"Sure, Amazon is convenient, typically. But over the past couple of years the customer service has gotten so bad. I returned an item three months ago and got my advance refund, as normal. I get an email a month ago stating I was going to be charged for this item. So I reached out and was told to disregard this email that they had this item and I won't be charged. Which, this has happened to me in the past. And typically it always gets taken care of. Last week I get another email stating I have been charged. So I reach out again to get refunded for it. Well they tell me they need me to submit some kind of form of ID because they have detected abnormal activity on my account before they can process my refund. Not sure how processing a refund back to my credit card that I have used for years has anything to do with this so called abnormal activity. Yet I have made several purchases and returns since this order from three months ago and have no issues. So I have spent days calling and chatting trying to get my refund issued back and was told a couple different times it was, only to find out it wasn't. Filed a complaint against them with the BBB because this is crazy thay they charged me for an item I returned three months ago. I was able to obtain the tracking number from one of the reps I had spoke with, since so much time had passes the return label wasn't available on my end. Of course after 120 days UPS tracking numbers are no longer valid. So I had to reach out to UPS, and they emailed the proof of delivery. Which Amazon received the return within two days of me shipping it back. So, I've been emailing back and forth with different reps making the same bs excuses and won't even tell me why this order is any different from my other orders that they feel the need to have my ID uploaded. They keep saying it is to protect my account. If protecting my account was the case and there was abnormal activity, why let me continue to place orders?! I could understand if this was for an item over $300, but it was for a $22 sports bra! Not sure hoe not refunding me my money is protecting me. I'm not uploading any personal information through an email and I should not have to. I never should have been charged in the first place. I think someone at Amazon simply misplaced the item and don't want to own up to their mistake and they are trying to keep money. I did end up disputing the charge with my credit card company and provided more than enough documentation showing they have my return and correspondence showing they received it and a refund has been issued, even though they didn't issue it. This whole experience has ruined shopping at Amazon for me. I had a ton of subscription orders and canceled all of those and will not be renewing my Prime either.

3272,US,Don't rely on Amazon CS to solve a problem,"Tried to purchase an inverter which is the same model as one I bought last year from Amazon shipped to the same address.  This time Amazon website would not accept the address.  I tried different addresses of friend same result.  I contacted Amazon CS twice to get problem resolved.  Today (after going through all their hoops like deleting my address and re-entering it which I had already tried) I got on with the ""top tier"" supervisor who finally said there was nothing wrong with my address but the item is restricted to certain addressed due to regulations.  My B.S. sensor went off scale so I asked him what restrictions?  He could not answer because he had better things to do other that actually fix a difficult problem.  During the entire call I remained respectful even though I was being treated as if my business was of no value to them.  I explained to this guy that I could purchase the identical unit (electronically) but was in a larger housing due to it being a marine version of the same inverter and there was no restrictions related to that unit.  He did not care to explain why because it would have actually meant he had to think about something outside his window of knowledge.  To be sure after the call I went back to their website put the ""restricted"" item in my cart and used the address autofill function of their website to arbitrarily find addressed in other states and I could not find an address that was not restricted.  So Amazon has an issue with this particular item and they will not do anything to correct it because they simply do no care about any one customer.  It does not matter if you spend thousands on their website, it does not matter how long you have been a customer, it does not matter how great a customer you have been YOU DO NOT MATTER TO AMAZON!

My ordeal began with the delivery of a pack of 10, M8 x 1m (1000mm) Zinc Plated Threaded Rod/Bar, which was irresponsibly posted through my letterbox by Royal Mail, resulting in significant damage to my vinyl flooring.However, the core of my frustration lies in Amazon's response to this incident. Despite the severity of the damage and the clear evidence provided, including photographs and a video from my Ring Doorbell, Amazon has completely denied any responsibility for the mishap. Their justification is that the item was sold by a third-party seller and delivered by Royal Mail, thereby absolving themselves of any accountability.This lack of ownership and customer care is appalling. As a customer, I purchased this product through the Amazon platform, trusting in their promise of quality service and reliable delivery. The fact that Amazon refuses to acknowledge their role in this chain of responsibility, or to offer any form of assistance or compensation, is unacceptable.The damage to my property is not just a minor inconvenience; it is a significant financial and emotional burden. The flooring that was damaged was costly, and the idea that neither Amazon nor their delivery partners are willing to address this issue is deeply troubling.This experience has severely eroded my trust in Amazon. It's clear that their customer service and support systems are severely lacking when it comes to handling issues with third-party sellers and delivery partners. I am left feeling frustrated and disregarded as a customer.To anyone considering making a purchase through Amazon, especially for items involving third-party sellers or heavy goods, I urge caution. Based on my experience, if anything goes wrong, you may find yourself in a similar situation, with little to no support from Amazon.In conclusion, I am extremely dissatisfied with how Amazon has handled this situation.

3317,GB,TERRIBLE DELIVERY SERVICE.,"What is going on with Amazon.  I have been promised deliveries for the early afternoon only to find that it then states a delivery time in the evening because (the courier has picked up more orders on the way to my address).  This is totally unacceptable,  people do not want to stay in waiting for a parcel only to find they have wasted a full day waiting for their order to be delivered. Deliveries at 9 and 10 in the evening are unacceptable especially when they were originally promised for lunchtime.  The other problem is that Amazon keep losing my parcels. Items are promised for next day delivery and then I find the parcel has gone missing and I have to wait a few days to see if it turns up and if it doesn't I have to contact Amazon and then wait another few days for a refund.  Because the parcel does not turn up we don't know for sure if it has been lost and have no idea if it will be delivered at all so we decide to go out and when we get back home, lo and behold the parcel is sitting on the door step facing the road.  I know they say it is free next day delivery but it really isn't because when you check the price of the item you want to order, it is   often cheaper elsewhere, even with the postage and packing some companies charge us for delivery.

They would both arrive on the 14th or 15th of november, but on the 15th I received two emails explaining for both books that they are currently unavailable and that they would email me when a new delivery date was known. Well, i contacted customer service about this, and I got a very 'know-it-all' CSA , they explained to me that they are currently sold out of both books and are waiting on confirmation of the publisher... Excuse me? I pre-ordered, what do you mean sold out? The CSA kept telling me that this is how a pre-order works , no! If I pre-order I reserve a book for myself. If Amazon does not have the stock, then they shouldn't sell it. And both books were still available for pre-order long after I bought them, so I know a LOT of people are as disappointed as I am right now. But the CSA wouldn't answer my question of why, they just kept repeating that this is a pre-order. Bs. Then, i contacted another CSA and they told me one of my orders was canceled!!!?? I have never approved this cancellation and I still have not received any email about this. I did get my money back, but it seems like contacting customer service had triggered this cancellation because Amazon still hasnt cancelled my other book. But moral of the story, dont pre-order from Amazon, they are just trying to make as much money without actually knowing if they can deliver. So pre-order on your own risk, its a gamble. I also cannot order a new book because it's literally sold out everywhere and I cant undo the cancellation.

Once hailed as the epitome of convenience with their same day, next day, and two-day deliveries, it has become a hit or miss experience.I remember when I could rely on Amazon to deliver my most important items promptly, without fail. However, in recent times, I’ve had multiple instances where these deliveries were either delayed or, worse, lost altogether. Needless to say, this has left me feeling frustrated and dissatisfied.It is absolutely unacceptable for a service that prides itself on efficiency and reliability to provide such unreliable service. Customers rely on Amazon to deliver their goods on time, especially when they’re crucial and time-sensitive items. Countless times I’ve found myself waiting anxiously, only to be disappointed when the delivery is delayed or simply never arrives.It’s disheartening to see a company that was once the gold standard for fast and reliable deliveries struggle to maintain that standard. If Amazon wishes to retain its loyal customers and attract new ones, they need to address these shortcomings immediately. Not only should they improve their communication regarding delayed deliveries, but they should also take concrete steps to prevent these delays and losses from happening in the first place.I hope Amazon realizes the impact these delivery issues have on their customers.

3361,GB,What an Absolute joke,"What an Absolute joke. For many years the pay in 5 months instalments via Amazon themselves has been active on my account, I've used it loads of times in the past without missing a payment as well as I've literally just finished paying off my last item a few days ago with no issues whatsoever. So after doing some research and asking others in shops at the check out they have all said the same that theirs has just vanished. However I've checked on my mother in law's Amazon account and her's is still active. Like huh how is her's still active and mines gone? My Amazon account is squeaky clean and I've easily spent 20k+ over the years. So until Amazon decide to put this back I will never use them again and the 1 star will remain.Update 06/05/2024: amazon has finally put the pay monthly option back on to my account, however I have noticed now that they request the full amount of the item first through your bank but they don't take any money, then once that's confirmed they will only charge the monthly amount, so if you have less money in your account than the item you want to purchase, they will not allow you to pay in 5 or 12 monthly instalments when they used to only requested the monthly amount. Now what is the point of this monthly payment if you have to have the same amount of money or more in your account than the item?? if you have the full amount in your account then you don't need to pay in instalments. So what an absolute joke and complete shambles. Worst part of it is, when I spoke to amazon the person said they have not changed how it works and it's been like that for years then left the chat then another advisor came on. But I can 100% guarantee you they have changed how it works. So it looks like I know more than the fully trained amazon advisor. So the 1 star remains until they take the request of the full amount off and put it back to what it was before.",2024,05,November,2023,32.0,1.0,low

When I further pressed I was told that the charges could be connected  to a previous account that I had years ago. She said that she could see I had this account but she could not access it.

Knowing this I took the time to contact Amazon and was told don't worry Mr Brown you have no subscription and no up and coming subscriptions I explained what the subscription was for and when expired.

Amazon started taking money out of my account in August and I only noticed this November.I made contact and explained I was told I would be credited back the 4 months then I was cut off when I wanted to complain about the fact that it had been debited after I had taken the time to stop the subscription. It then turned in to hours of my time wasted with Amazon customer service to have the money given back.Because its not my Amazon account and belongs to my 7 year old daughter they could not deal with me. I had to contact again through my daughters account even though it could be anyone on there they even asked to speak to her. Its pathetic I am the father owner of the credit card and due to data protection use this as an excuse. They tell you when have contact via phone call you are taped by chat you have the transcript which I will add was wiped on my account on my device .however I did after being told find it on another device when I added my details so I have taken snap shots. I like this as the customer and the seller can see and listen to exactly what has been said.Amazon will not acknowledge that I made contact with them to cancel the subscription.I've asked for an apology and only had a verbal one and now as its not my Amazon account they will only speak with the account holder my 7yr old even though its my credit card Pathetic Amazon.What happened to the customer service integrity common sense ?Thank you for my time you wasted and as soon as the credit hits my account I will be closing my Amazon account a drop in the ocean.Customers beware of this Peter B,2023,11,November,2023,14.0,1.0,low

3427,US,Amazon Flex - Driver Support is Equivalent to Poo Poo,"Amazon Flex - Side GigThe quality of Driver Support is severely lacking; it appears to be more of a facade than genuine concern. Support is often incapable of providing meaningful assistance to drivers and tends to offer recommendations that harm their standings. Despite my brief tenure of less than 15 days and only 5 attempted/completed deliveries, I've filed numerous reports without satisfactory resolutions. No one responds to your support emails and direct contact with Support is useless. They're dismissive and just want to end the call so they can carry on with their laziness.There is a noticeable lack of care from just about everyone, exemplified by unanswered emails, unhelpful support responses, and the logistical failure of multiple drivers delivering to the same location simultaneously. My account seems to be shadow banned without any fault on my part, a consequence of ill-advised recommendations from support representatives. Once shadow banned, available offers are scarce and undesirable, often requiring the completion of more deliveries than you can actually handle and in an unreasonably short time frame, particularly to challenging locations. (apartments, building complex's, gates, codes, with poorly written instructions)It's perplexing that, despite only three deliveries, I've garnered a multitude of compliments from customers, yet support continues to recommend actions detrimental to drivers' scores. With one incident again, recommended by a support rep, I am now seeing 0 offers and the offers that I do see are so bad that you're almost always going to be late. A company of such stature, built on innovative minds, should prioritize refining its Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Standard Work Instructions (SWIs). The current lack of coherence in support recommendations suggests a need for substantial improvement.The repercussions are evident when company leadership prioritizes personal gain over reinvesting in the company. Profiting extensively from AliExpress products, they display negligence towards their flawed mobile applications, lackluster pay, subpar support team, and logistical shortcomings.

Was it really escalated and taken care of though? I've dealt with it before and complained and I was told the same thing. I can't stand when anyone but myself and my boyfriend walk or try to walk between my vehicles. That's ignorant. There is no reason for it especially where my front door is they can just walk through grass. I'm tired of reaching out about this. Always seems to be random drivers that haven't been here before too. But I have it listed on my account for drivers not to walk between my vehicles at all.

I will stop ordering from Amazon for as long as I live here if I'm going to continue to get ignorant drivers.

Pre drilled holes in wrong place, gaps as wood not long enough at front and rear. Instruction book but none of pieces of wood labelled so like a massive jigsaw puzzle. Mercers did say they would replace damaged pieces or could return. (They obviously do not check quality of products and leave it to whether buyer will complain, ask for refund etc)I Explained I'm disabled, suffer mental health due to a mental breakdown and i  am not well, also offered to supply proof if they needed( blanked my messages). I had to pay someone to assemble as cannot do myself, they followed the Instruction pamplet step by step but pieces didn't fit as holes in wrong places, so could not use all the dowels. They wanted pics of rear of wardrobe but again explained I'm disabled and against wall.Ignored what i was saying and kept saying disassemble, box up and make appointment  to be collected. I couldnt cope, got upset to point of tears that I said I'd keep as found the whole process extremely upsetting and take money off. I Provided pics of damage, the unit not square,with pics of spirit level showing not straight.

I went into Amazon where the lens was showing as still having 6 available. I finally contacted Amazon by phone, asking to speak to a Manager, there was a definitely a language barrier, I found it extremely difficult understanding what they were saying, with at least 2 customer service reps speaking very bad English, and did not understand what I wanted and basically just put the phone down on me.I could not get in touch with a manager at all, despite trying for over an hour, finally I used the chat option. I was put through to someone who said he was a member of the leadership team, who told me the 6 that were showing available, were already pre-ordered, (which is surly rubbish, as if pre-ordered surely they shouldn't show as being available).  I said that I had ordered these on Friday and if they weren't available, why had they taken the money for these out of my account?  He was not able/refused to answer that question.Earlier this week I had a generated email from Amazon, telling me I was cancelling items and if this continued they would not refund me.  When I got in touch with them about this, they said it was automatically generated email.  I pointed out that what they were saying about refunding was illegal and that, in my case, it was they who were cancelling items not I.  This is all very strange isn't it?

3521,US,"Stolen iPad by Amazon-NO REFUND, BLOCKED account","I have been a loyal Amazon customer since 2016, consistently engaging in numerous transactions with a clear and honest track record. It is with great regret and frustration that I find myself compelled to leave a 1-star review after a recent experience that has left me questioning Amazon’s commitment to customer service and fair play.I recently purchased a 10th generation 256 GB iPad (Order No. 113-7489110-7733059), but upon delivery, I was shocked to discover a metal plate instead of the iPad I had ordered. Acting promptly, I reported the incident to Amazon within 30 minutes of delivery, providing all necessary documentation, including a detailed police report (Report No. 01-23-094996). Despite initially assuring me that a refund was in process, Amazon later retracted this and, without any valid justification, suspended my account, tainting my reputation by labeling me as a 'serial offender'.The handling of my case was not only unjust but it also highlighted a severe lack of evidence on Amazon’s part to substantiate their claims. Despite my efforts to resolve the issue amicably, including providing photographic evidence and engaging in extensive communication, Amazon has remained uncooperative. The discrepancy in package weight and the condition of the packaging upon receipt were clear indicators of tampering, yet my concerns were dismissed.My intent behind this review is not only to express my dissatisfaction but also to alert others to the potential pitfalls of dealing with Amazon’s customer service. It’s disheartening to have one's integrity doubted and to be denied a basic consumer right — the right to receive the purchased product or a refund.As I continue to seek a resolution through the Delaware Department of Justice Consumer Protection Unit, I am left with a tarnished view of a company I once held in high esteem. I can only hope that this review serves as a call for Amazon to improve their support processes and to treat their customers with the respect and honesty they deserve.Buyer beware – your loyalty may not shield you from a similar ordeal.",2023,11,October,2023,1.0,1.0,low

My purchase of a rice cooker from Amazon turned into a frustrating ordeal that highlighted their poor customer service and lack of empathy towards international customers.I purchased a rice cooker from Amazon, hoping to have a reliable kitchen appliance. However, the product arrived broken, rendering it completely unusable. As I was overseas at the time, I utilized a freight forwarder to have the product shipped to my location. Unfortunately, due to logistical constraints and the time taken for the shipment, I couldn't initiate the return process within the ten-day window provided by Amazon.Upon contacting their customer support, I was met with a series of canned responses that lacked any form of empathy or understanding of my situation. It seemed as though I was conversing with automated robots rather than individuals capable of critical thinking and problem-solving. Their refusal to provide a replacement or a refund left me feeling utterly disregarded and disrespected as a customer.It is deeply disheartening to encounter such a lack of consideration for the challenges faced by international customers. The rigid adherence to a ten-day return window, coupled with the robotic and unhelpful nature of their customer support, has significantly tarnished my perception of Amazon's commitment to customer satisfaction.As a loyal customer who has relied on Amazon for various purchases over the years, this experience has left me disillusioned and hesitant to continue using their services. I urge Amazon to reevaluate their customer service protocols and extend greater support and understanding to customers facing genuine difficulties, especially those outside the United States.

There is never holes in the packaging, the packaging is bent but even then how is this much dirt getting on the books?In the end, I've come to the conclusion that sellers are just selling really dirty books and nobody cares if you send it back or not, because the majority of the time people won't send them back or they'll forget. Thankfully, these specific books can be bought in bookstores for £3 more and they actually take care of them.It's pathetic that amazon thinks this is okay. However, they also seem to have a tendency to sell you broken ram sticks   costing almost £40 that just do not work on computers.I'm not paying for damaged items, and the reviews always say they're wonderful, but I still get damaged products.",2023,10,October,2023,5.0,1.0,low

3561,NL,Got my money back through my legal insurance,"I have ordered stuff online for two decades, sometimes from sketchy shops with little hope for customer protection, yet I never got scammed. Until I ordered from Amazon.On April 2023 I placed a fairly expensive order (403-1085610-9838734) worth almost 600 euro, to only receive the wrong goods in a damaged and incomplete fashion. Although I immediately contacted Amazon I ended up in a nightmare for five long frustrating months without any reasonable compensation. I finally threatened to sue Amazon and got my money back through my legal insurance!Their nerve to claim ""Amazon strives to be Earth’s most customer-centric company"" is utterly appalling. Never in my life have I been treated so horribly. Amazon is by far the very worst online shopping experience I can imagine. Their level of incompetence is simply criminal.The whole thing went wrong when an Amazon helpdesk employee filed a ATOZ claim prematurely that had me waiting for one month, voiding my right to get reimbursed. It was their mistake for which I received multiple apologies from Amazon but which in the course of another four months couldn't be fixed. All this time I remained patient, polite and confident that Amazon would make right. Only, despite promises, they never did. After finally threatening Amazon with a lawsuit Amazon's Executive Customer Relations stepped in, making me a truly despicable offer: to put my money on a voucher ""with something extra for the inconvenience"". How on earth is that reasonable? The item I ordered was no longer available through Amazon, so I kindly declined the extra's and just demanded my money back. Their response: ""We apologize we could not find a solution to the problem. Unfortunately we are unable to offer any new information. We will no longer respond to anything related to this order."" Not find a solution? How about just giving people back their money when you screw up so miserably, causing five months of frustration?Although my case was solid and well documented my legal insurance advised against litigation because a lawsuit could take another five months to win. My patience had run out and I ended agreeing to be paid out my incurred losses by the insurance. Amazon went scot-free and probably continues to scam more honest customers out of their money. Utterly disgusting. Naturally I terminated anything related to Amazon. This will remain the first and last time I was robbed of my money by a billion dollar company...

3563,CZ,Amazon bad service,"Subject: Complaint regarding refund issues and poor customer serviceDear Amazon Customer Service,I am writing to you with great dissatisfaction and frustration regarding my recent experience with Amazon. As a loyal customer, I expect a certain level of service, which unfortunately has been severely lacking in my recent interactions with your company. I made a purchase on Amazon, using my own funds, for an item. To my disappointment, the wrong size was sent to me not once, but three times. In order to expedite the process, I used the return refunds provided to me in gift card form and immediately repurchased the item. However, due to the repeated errors made by Amazon, I finally requested a refund for the item to be returned to my original account.To my dismay, it took four weeks and multiple attempts to contact customer service to receive a response. Eventually, the refund was processed, but contrary to what I was informed, it was credited back to the gift card instead of my original account. I subsequently reached out to seniormanagers and was assured on four separate occasions that the refund would be transferred to my account within seven days.However, it has now been an unreasonable amount of time, and I still have not received the refund in my original account. Furthermore, when I contacted Amazon again to rectify the situation, I was informed that they could not refund the money from the gift card, which was originally my own money.I am deeply disappointed and frustrated by this level of service. It is unacceptable for Amazon to provide false information and promises regarding refunds, causing undue inconvenience and financial loss on my part.I kindly request a thorough investigation into this matter and a prompt resolution. I expect the refund to be immediately credited back to my original account without any further delays. Additionally, I would appreciate appropriate compensation for the time, effort, and frustration I have experienced as a result of Amazon's errors and poor customer service.I value my long-standing relationship with Amazon and hope that this complaint prompts a change in the way you handle such situations. I trust that you will take immediate action to rectify these issues and restore my faith in the company.I look forward to your prompt response resolving this matter.Thank you for your attention to this urgent issue.Yours sincerely,Nigel Lane",2023,10,October,2023,1.0,1.0,low

I was really annoyed, no bathroom breaks?!. The warehouse employees are fired at the year 3 of how long they have been working. The company has stated that after three years, the employees are 'lazy'. They pay you to leave. Instead of fixing the speed of shipping, why not fix the employee situation?. These are human beings. Even the ones with color do not get treated fairly. Even though Amazon has a 'black lives matter' thing on their website or advertisements, it is lie.I say to myself, it is not just with the people you see at a store, to me, it is about the whole company, is the CEO willing to change something’s about their company.

After 2 weeks, I still had not received a refund, so I called customer service once again. Apparently, something was missed so they hadn't issued a refund. 5 days later, my credit card was refunded.As requested, I re-ordered the product. Once again, I received only the cover and not the rails. When I called Amazon, I was told I couldn't return it because it hadn't been delivered even though it was clearly sitting in my garage (apparently it did not show up as delivered in their system). I waited until it showed as delivered online and called customer service again (4th time if you're keeping count). Same story... they cannot send me the missing box so I will have to return the cover and re-order.This has been going on for almost 2 months now.The saga continues... Given this is an oversized item, it must be picked up by a local carrier. After 10 days, 3 calls to customer service, and 4 emails to customer service, I finally received the email I needed that needed to be forwarded to the local carrier. 2 weeks after initial delivery, the box was picked up and is on route to Amazon.Not over yet!

3581,US,Cancelled by Amazon,"I have been posting book reviews on Amazon for many years, always buying the books at the site to get the cachet of “Verified purchase”. My efforts resulted in more than thirty reviews appearing on Amazon, many rated as either “Top Positive Review” or “Top Critical Review”. But when I submitted a review of “The Last Politician” by Franklin Foer, I got a terse email from Amazon that it could not be posted “because it doesn’t meet our guidelines for one or more of these reasons: Profanity, Harassment, Hate Speech, Sexual Content, Illegal Activity, Private Information”. This had never happened before, and I was quite surprised. I went to the link that showed the “Community Guidelines” and read all six pages, scratching my head, trying to figure what I’d done wrong and then I realized the issue was politics. The person checking my review was apparently an extreme liberal so I made some changes that I thought might let my piece “pass” and I resubmitted it. But I soon realized this was a waste of time because I could make changes piecemeal again and again, but without knowing exactly what in my 850 word review was the ”problem”, my efforts would be fruitless.How could I get the nameless and faceless Amazon person behind the “wizard’s curtain” to tell me what to do? I remembered seeing on my “Author’s Page” a place where I could recommend books. I’d never used this feature before but now got the idea to cite Franklin Foer’s book as a “Recommendation”, writing in the comments, “I wrote a review of this book that did not pass the Amazon Moderator and I hope they will tell me what to change.” This was an act of desperation because I truly wanted to get my review posted and I was willing to make rewrites but had to have some guidance, sort of like we got from our high school English teacher who would take a red pencil and underline the problem.Apparently, my ploy with Amazon backfired because I soon got an email saying my post was “outside of our guidelines” and “consider this to be a first warning.” Amazon’s ire was about the book recommendation I’d put on my author’s page (specifically the comments showing Amazon in a bad light) since this was the only “post” I’d ever made other than book reviews.This was going nowhere, and I was not going to play Amazon’s games. I replied to the email, saying, “if you cannot tell me what I am doing wrong I will cancel my book advertising, Amazon Prime, and the Amazon prime credit card and quit making purchases from Amazon.” Six days later I got a reply email saying, “You have repeatedly posted content that violates our Community Guidelines . . . [and therefore] we’ve removed your ability to participate in Community features.” This was untrue because I’d only made one post, the one where I said, “I hope they [Amazon Moderator] will tell me what to change [in the review that had been rejected].”Unfortunately, all the book reviews I’d posted on Amazon over the years were deleted. This was quite disappointing because I’d spent hundreds of dollars on dozens of books, reading them closely over countless hours in order to write honest and informed book reviews and now my work had come to naught. I truly doubt that anyone has put more effort(both in the reading and the writing) into creating a book review than I have. Amazon’s actions have not only hurt me but are a disservice to millions of readers who rely on quality reviews to make wise decisions in their book purchases.As I said earlier, I’ve submitted critical assessments of other books to Amazon and never had a problem and I must conclude the current issue is over politics, simply having a different opinion. While I did say some positives about the author, I also faulted him for being almost sycophantic toward Biden. What he wrote was an uncritical fluff piece and I called it as such. The review, as written, would be passable to any reasonable person and there is nothing out of bounds in it. I read the book thoroughly and wrote an honest, critical review with no malice or evil intent. For anyone interested, a google search of “book reviews of ‘The Last Politician’” will take you to Goodreads where you’ll find my piece and you can decide for yourself.",2023,10,October,2023,3.0,2.0,low
3582,US,I can't believe Amazon's customer service and how bad it is they think they can steal from me please don't mind my spelling in the story and what Amazon's doing to me,I have never been treated like this in my life by a company lied to hung up on told one thing and then another different thing the next time I call I had to go to the length of recording my last conversations with the customer service at Amazon because of the lying I didn't return because they sent me a drone and I did not know that the Drone they sent me was the wrong drone it was a $240 drone when I ordered a $490 room they tried telling me that it's been too long to return it and I told them well I didn't even know until a friend of mine showed me his drone which we both ordered the same drones at the same time he got a totally different one than me and then looking it up it was a $200 less drone they told me that I was just out of luck and I'm put to what bite the ball and let them keep my $200 no so I'm fighting it finally I got a manager to agree to the return this was a month ago so I returned the item took 6 days for them to get the Drone back I know this for a fact because I tracked the package the first person I talked to about it I told them look on your website it says returns will be processed when item is received 1 to 5 business days that's exactly what it said on the return policy for that drill I called them they said it was not there and they did not receive it then I double checked with ups and they said it was there I called the next day and the gentleman that answered the next day said it was there and I had to wait for it to be processed okay perfect at least I know it's there I wait about 5-6 days I call back and I talked to a lady and I say okay so why hasn't my return gone through yet why haven't you guys refunded my money and she says well the drones not there and I said the gentleman yesterday told me it was there and he could see it was at the facility and I told her so I'm getting copies of all this and once I told her I was getting copies of all the tracking she hung up on me so I was a little frustrated and irritated about 3 days later I had another claim for A to Z claim that was put to be processed that the people never even put in I don't know if they're just pretending to type so that you hear typing or what but three different times they did that on this separate order I still haven't received anything from that and I'm going on over 3 weeks but back to the Drone so the next day when I called in they were trying to make excuses of why I wasn't receiving the money due to not being able to return to drone even though the manager said I could return it because they gave me the wrong item and it wasn't my fault and I didn't notice it till I saw my friends drone so they told me okay you know what you'll get the money and one to three days I was like oh cool finally you know it's been almost 3 weeks now and that time went by nothing called again spoke with someone else they said that nothing hasn't even been done they don't even see where that person put in that information in the computer I told him don't you guys record these conversations can't you see this and at that point is when I started thinking you know what I better start recording it so they don't have any clue where the packages what they're doing and where my return money is they've had the item for over a week now so now two weeks pass still have the item I've been calling every two days asking what's going on no one can tell me anything they're not entering any information on their computer so I'm screen recording our conversations with the guys and they don't have a clue about anything they're telling me I can't return that item and I'm sitting there arguing with them that they already have the item they've had it for 2 weeks now finally I get someone at customer service after I wait another two days to call I talked to someone for a month in now he says you know what I know you probably really need your money back and we've had the Drone for a long time and I'm going to see what I can do about this I won't let you hang up till I get this fixed so I'm recording all this so I have all these conversations now he's telling me that he can't make it happen it won't work it won't let him and I'm not understanding are you guys ripping me off and stealing my money now is Amazon ripping people off and still in their money so he says that he's going to go a different route and try to return other items if I cancel my return return other items to make the amount of the Drone so now he's put money back on like a prepaid gift card that I lose money on every time I spend money on it and so forth and so he gave me a $170 just remember now it's a $497 drone and that's it and that was after waiting three days again to get that money so now I'm just at Whitson and I can't believe Amazon would screw people over like this I don't know who they have running customer service but I'm at the point where I'm ready to never use Amazon again and boycott them for all the lying and thieving that they're doing right now it must be Amazon's new

This would be the same seller, that Amazon now tells me, has NO STOCK of the original book I ordered... leaving me to conclude that a book known to be misnamed on their stock inventory may have been shipped.Bottom line; this is a lot less like 'good service' than I would like.  The tick-box systems of so many businesses these days offers NO obvious clues that Amazon are likely to do much more than refer me to the task of reading their (no doubt) extensive T&C's which will justify their lax attitude to putting right the mistakes THEIR contacts have made.The one star refers to this issue.

3600,US,I would give minus 5 if I could!,"I would give minus 5 if I could!Trust me do not order ANYTHING from Amazon!I just went through 2 days of absolute HELL with these A$$HOLES!They actually made me call my local police and file a police report for something they 100% screwed up on!They delivered my order to an entity that don’t even exist and refused to refund the order.Amazon said “Delivered October 24 Your package was left in the mail room. Signed by: Mail Room”, their exact words, copied and pasted right from the message they sent me.Here’s the big problem, THERE IS NO “MAIL ROOM” anywhere within the 22 units of the condo complex I live in, there is no “mail room” attendant to sign for ANYTHING!Where this package actually went is a big mystery because no driver ever came to my door!I sat right by where my doorbell is all day, my doorbell is in 100% working condition, also I posted 2 signs on my door one saying ring doorbell multiple times and the other saying if no answer call number, I put my number on the sign.As I said no one came to my door, no one rang my doorbell, no one called my phone and the kicker is, THERE IS NO “MAIL ROOM”!So after going through hell talking to multiple people, explaining the exact same thing to each and every one of them over and over again for 2 days and eventually at the end of the next day being on the phone with these a$$holes for another hour they tell me I have to wait until after 5PM before I can request to cancel and get a refund or re-delivery, not very happy, I’m like whatever.So I call back after 5PM, I’m now on the phone again getting jerked around as usual once again for like God only knows how long.They then tell me that I have to call my local police and file a police report, I had to ask them to repeat this a few times because I thought I heard them say I had to file a police report and to my complete and utter surprise that was exactly what they were telling me.I ask them why do I have to file a police report over something that was your fault, you delivered my items to the wrong place, you delivered my items to a place that don’t even exist, you delivered my items to somewhere other than the address I gave you without my consent, your delivery driver never once ever came to my door or even attempted to ever contact me and you are making me file a police report.This so called customer service representative would not even listen to anything I was saying and all she kept saying talking over me is, “is there anything else I can help you with sir”, that was all she keep saying to me, in other words go screw yourself, I am done with you sir and there is nothing you can do about it.So I hung up called my local police and ask him if he’s ever heard of anything like this, he said “Amazon” I thought they just cancel the order and re-ship you another item, I said that’s what ebay does I know this for sure but  not Amazon they make me file a police report for something they screwed up, he was as surprised as I was.So he directed me where to go to file a police report.I then spent more of my time filling out a police report over something that was 100% Amazons fault and I made this very clear on the police report.I tried to copy and paste it here but it’s a PDF file so it’s not possible.Amazon is nothing but big greedy corporate a$$holes who could care less about consumers who make them filthy rich, they hire foreigners in a foreign country paying them absolutely nothing likely with zero benefits and undermining American workers all to fill their greedy pockets.Amazon is way too big and way to greedy and their customer service is beyond horrifying, it’s beyond belief and no one should buy anything from these greedy corporate a$$holes.I have been buying online with eBay well over 20 years with PayPal and yes, they are big corporate, but the truth is in over 20 years I have never, EVER ran into anything remotely close to what I just ran into with Amazon.This was my first order with my new account, and this is how I was treated, unreal and just flat out wrong and no way to treat any customer bring business to your company.Any problems I have ran into buying on eBay the issue was resolved immediately either by Ebay or PayPal and was always handled by them I never had to file some police report.I’ve had items missing on several occasions with eBay and they never questioned me, they just simply sent me another item with absolutely no issues unlike these a$$wipes at Amazon, should be Ama-a$$holes!Fair warning to everyone, never order from Amazon, you just may regret it, I sure as hell do!I will NEVER EVER order anything from these evil, greedy corporate pigs and I will spend the rest of my life as long as Amazon still exist warning everyone to never buy from this place!",2023,10,October,2023,2.0,1.0,low

Between frequently defective streaming service, 3rd party commerce fraud, and illegal in-house withholding and contractual lies, this steaming pile of whistled Dixie knows not when to quit, even allows its own staff to violate their own forums with self immolating hate crime to torture their less happy customers--who retrospectively vilifies every psychotic ""genius"" he can of whom thinks that they can grift our unsuspecting OP for whatever it's worth--by pathologically lying in many forum accepted comments that hate breeds hate, neither supported nor condoned, not surprisingly expected and noted, neither surprisingly similar to the compulsive bull, forum violations, and finite fraud of both Amazon staff and whoever reported it the 1st place.

3645,GB,Literally thieves,"I recently purchased a video game from Amazon, and I couldn't have had a worse experience. The game arrived without the disc, and to make matters worse, the case wasn't wrapped in cellophane, and the disc slot was empty. It's painfully clear that someone at their warehouse pilfered the disc itself. This situation was extremely frustrating and infuriating.When I contacted Amazon's customer service, it took a mind-numbing 30 minutes to explain what had happened because, frankly, it seemed like they were completely clueless. It's as if they were living in a different world, disconnected from the problem I was facing.After I explained the situation, I was told I needed to wait for a ""72-hour investigation."" The entire time, I had to be the one reaching out to them for updates because they never took the initiative to keep me informed. Their customer service representatives were unbelievably rude, and they would abruptly end chats without my consent, as if they didn't want to deal with me anymore.After nearly a week of back-and-forth, I finally received a refund. However, this refund didn't include the £5 voucher I had used for the purchase, which effectively left me out of pocket. I repeatedly asked how to make a formal complaint about the whole ordeal, and it seemed like they were actively avoiding my question and cutting me off. The lack of transparency and accountability was appalling.In conclusion, this experience with Amazon was a nightmare. The missing disc, the inept customer service, and the loss of the voucher all added up to a terrible shopping experience. I would strongly advise potential buyers to exercise caution and be prepared for a potential lack of assistance should anything go wrong with their purchase.

It is my understanding, they will still deny a refund, which seems wrong.Amazon has asked me to return items for a refund on items I never received.Today I was told I had to file a police report about stolen packages, however, I have proof these packages were delivered to the wrong location, which is not the same as having them stolen. Filing a false report of theft is a Class A misdemeanor and I'm not willing to commit a crime because Amazon delivered several packages to the wrong address.They say based on 'their investigation' and my response, the items were stolen, unless they see my ring camera, which shows no packages, it seems their investigation is incomplete.",2023,10,October,2023,1.0,1.0,low

3691,US,No more big ticket items,"For big ticket items, Amazon apparently has a policy that refunds can take up to 30 days. Now, I've been a regular customer (who isn't). Between me and my husband, we probably buy something from Amazon 2-3 times a week. Then one day we buy a big ticket item ($350), return it, and this happens. It certainly leaves a bad taste in my mouth about this company, but more, I am so disheartened because I have really loved Amazon. Calling customer service is something I've rarely done. I don't even mind the song-and-dance scripted responses. I know the call center people are just doing their jobs, and they're honest people just like us. I am always polite when I speak to them, but the clincher for me was when I asked to speak to the supervisor, the guy practically told me in not so many words, 'If I transfer you, ma'am, I guarantee he will tell you the same thing anyway.' Through polite insistence, I managed to make him transfer me to his lead guy, who seemed to be more polished in language and demeanor. After more song-and-dance exchange, the bottom line is the lead person couldn't even override the system to plead my 'proven and very legitimate' case. But he at least gave me a viable excuse. They received my package through UPS a week ago, yet my app dashboard does not reflect that. Apparently, the communication breakdown comes from the return center, who has not processed the return. I am exasperated. The $382 refund is not going to bankrupt me, sure, but what this tells me is this: it's only going to get worse as this mega shopping platform gets even bigger.",2023,10,October,2023,1.0,1.0,low

I gave time for a refund to be made (products were purchased on 10/2), and finally I called today (10/16) and was then informed that it would take 5-7 days for the refund to be carried out - unless I decided to agree to an Amazon Card in which case it could be immediate. In other words - if I agree to another Amazon product then I can get a refund immediately, otherwise you will have held on to my money for a total of 19-21 days. You are always ready to take my money the moment I order something, but to refund takes days if not weeks. Additionally, if I had not taken the time to call about this issue, I would never have received a refund - I wonder how much money you take from this kind of poor customer service?

I know this because the UPS tracking site shows this. Amazon has not synced its systems to correspond, and so we are now - out rather we were - running round in circles, speaking to people who seemed wholly incapable of independent thought.Talk about sacrificing something of yourself to perform as a robot in a consumer supply chain.Not one of the people we have been in contact with at Amazon have been able to do anything but regurgitate the company line.We are now told that customer complaints are dealt with internally - which is standard - which is where the results remain - which is not - with Amazon. Outcomes are not usually shared with the complainant.We asked what the point of complaining was if no feedback was released, to which there was no discernible reply. Seems there is no reply. Not a lawful one in any event.Amazon seems to have made its refund policy increasingly difficult to navigate. We strongly suggest that customers end all contact with this greedy industry. Take, take, take. That's the long and the short of it.We saw this coming when Amazon began to whittle down the benefits of being a Prime customer. Where once there was a ""Free to Me"" selection of movies, you now have an ads-free option, which isn't quite the same thing, with paid-for opting heavily outnumbering any kickbacks.Why bother?Also, Amazon Music makes it difficult to listen to your favourite tunes. Ever since the option to play your favourite album has been interfered with and the songs mixed up, any point of paying for Prime has gone out the window.Everything is engineered to illicit more and more cash from the customer. I get how difficult it can be to move on, but sometimes we just have to cut our losses and look for better deals elsewhere.There are other options. There are alternatives. Amazon does not have to be - indeed it is not - the only vehicle through which to interact with the worldoutside your window.Greed has finally got the better of this company.

After many years as loyal customers, and being a Prime member for many years, spending a lot of money, I find myself writing a negative review.Whilst being Prime members we have never had problems with faulty, not as described, not received goods, etc. Now we have cancelled out Prime membership, the customer service and customer support has become sub-standard. It just shows that you are not treated equally and there is no equality.If we had a problem with an item, the money was refunded either as soon as the item was returned or within a very quick period of time. Now we have cancelled our Prime membership, we have had nothing but trouble getting a simple refund for an item that was clearly sold '!s new' but was infact 'ex-display' and not as described. This is a clear cut case and should have warranted an immediate refund.After contacting the seller and getting no response, then one response, and no further response, we contacted Amazon. There was excuse, after excuse. They eventually said they would refund the money and said it will be in your account, but it wasn't.So bearing in mind they said they had refunded it! Two days later they send a message saying, ""your A-Z claim has been successful and we will be refunding you payment."" So the initial refund they said they had refunded, they had not actually refunded it. Now I will have to wait another 7 days for a refund. In total that will be 15 days from the item being received back by the seller.Why would you receive lesser customer service than a Prime member? Surely, all customers should receive the same customer service, after all we are all customers. Why is a non-prime member discriminated against? We are disgusted and disappointed in the service we have paid for, and this is not the experience we have become accustomed to over the many years with amazon.We have spend thousands of pounds with Amazon over the years.

I ordered some curtains from a third-party seller which didn’t look anything like they did in the picture. I asked Amazon for a refund and they told me to contact the third party seller first. The third-party seller refused to give me a prepaid shipping label until I provided pictures. Which I did. After that I never heard from them again. I contacted Amazon again and was told that I could keep the curtains and that I would be receiving a refund within 3 to 5 business days. Well a week goes by and nothing. I call Amazon again and they tell me that that the first customer service representative shouldn’t have told me that and that the best they can do is open up a claim and in the meantime I should just try and send the curtains back myself and they’ll refund me the shipping cost. I go to UPS and they tell me that it’s gonna cost $600 bucks to send these curtains back. Then I receive an email from Amazon denying me on the claim. I call them yet again and tell them look, I can’t afford to send these curtains back for $600 bucks. They tell me not to worry they will send me a prepaid shipping label and I will get refunded for the curtains. This time I ask for an email confirming this. Which they send me. The representative also files an appeal on the first claim. I received another email telling me that the appeal has  been denied on the grounds that I did not contact the third-party seller within 30 days. I call Amazon AGAIN and send them screenshots proving that I got in touch with the third-party seller within a week and that their own representatives had told me I would be getting a prepaid label. When they finally get back in touch with me they tell me that both of their representatives shouldn’t have said that and they will train their employees better in the future but since both appeals were denied they can’t do anything. So what they’re telling me is that they allow their own customer services representatives to lie to you just to get you off of the phone and also sorry not sorry your just out $200 bucks for the curtains you can’t return. I ended up canceling my prime membership and opening up a claim with the Better Business Bureau, no matter what happens though I’ll never shop with them again.

I did once have a blip, something went very wrong (obviously these things will happen), however after contacting Amazon, straightaway the issue got satisfactorily resolved and I was even provided with a complete refund and agreeable compensation. I was so highly impressed with the professional manner in which that particular issue was dealt with. I find more and more these days so many high street brand stores often only provide top selling products with limited to zero choices being readily made available to the consumer and that includes their internet shopping sites. Time after time I’ve visited many of these companies and then swiftly moved across to Amazon. Being with Amazon the opposite is true, so many wide ranging products, such huge variety, so many obscure products, and the opportunity to shop at my convenience at anytime day or night so for these reasons thats why Amazon always tends getting my money and vote. The only negatives for me are:- I consider it’s important that people understand that some employees both in-house and self employed aren’t always being treated lawfully in so far as the meaning contained within the UK Employment Act and this is an extremely important issue that I consider should have a much higher priority within their internal HR department.

3836,US,Unacceptable Customer Service- AMAZON,"So I placed two orders this afternoon with Amazon - about 30 minutes apart.  Then I start getting emails that my prime card has been declined - wth?  I pay this account on time in full every single month - there’s no issue with my card.  Then I get a scam email pretending to be Amazon also saying my card has been declined - so weird!  So I go online to Amazon for help for which their chat bot is of no help -shocker!  Can’t even enter that their supplied menu does not fit why I need help -such a waste of time.  So I request a call back - I get one man, who speaks very poor English but I can make out that he doesn’t see an issue but that he has to transfer me to customer service “just to be sure”. So I’ve now been on hold for over 30 minutes with a lady whom I have already told that I am sorry but I simply cannot understand her.  I finally ascertain that she is telling me “I” need to call Synchrony Bank since the purchase has been declined.  I said absolutely not as there is not an issue with my card and I request an English-speaking manager.  She proceeds to tell me, of course, that there is not one, so I tell her she can cancel my prime account and I will leave a negative review here - hence the reason I am now on hold.  She asked to put me on hold for “2 minutes” -it has now been over 30, which is what prompted this review.  To me, this is “their” issue between them and synchrony bank (the 3rd party payment processor who handles so many accounts it will make your head spin). I am cancelling this order and will simply go elsewhere.  Amazon has simply become too damn big and they outsource their customer service, like so many other companies, which helps to keep the costs down I’m sure.

Once it was confirmed it was returned to sender on USPS I immediately contact Amazon and was told they were going to reattempt delivery and to wait until the next business day. I did that knowing it was a lie since it updated returned to sender. Next day it shows it arrived back to the sender and even updated on Amazon that it was returned to sender. I contacted Amazon once more and was transferred twice just to be told to fill out an incident report to ""Prove"" it didn't arrive. Like how the hell can you not see it was returned to sender?! what is there to prove? It shows it was returned to sender on the tracking. I filled out the incident report and was told I'd have to wait until after 09/26 and if I didn't get it by that evening to reach them for a refund.

Any pending orders have been canceled.We may not reply to further emails about this issue.""That made me worried that somehow someone had gained unauthorized access to my account and perhaps even my payment information, but the email contained no information. I could not reach support since you have to be logged in to be able to do that.After much search I found their Twitter support, wrote them, and they showed me a way to find a telephone number by stating that the password did not work on the website. I called, but the person on the other end could not help, but she took my details and my number, passed the information to account handling department and promised me that they would call me back within 24 hours. They never did. I never heard from them again.About a week before they closed my account, they charged me for a month's Amazon Prime. So I have paid for the better part of a month that I cannot use because they have closed my account without giving me a reason.

Since I bought with an Amazon Credit Card at that time, and the Amazon Credit Card ceased to exist in the UK later, I no longer could dispute the charge with my credit card. The refund would only be available as a gift card, which is not ideal, but I accepted since I wanted to spend less time fixing this issue. I got in touch one week later since my refund didn't happen.

One told me that she has to verify me before she can put me through English department (she was not able for 10 minutes to pick up my email address after several times being spelled to her - even in dutch and she told me because she cannot pick up my email, she cannot help me). After she finally got my email sheput me through, the line told me that they are too busy and they have to hang up my phone which they did themselves.Second employee she did not suddenly need to verify me before she put me through the English department and she transffered me right away without verification. I was waiting 15 minutes on the line to be picked up by the english team - no success.Thrid call and third employee of the dutch team was telling me that she cannot verify me on the phone and I have to click on link in email to be verified while on the phone - how strange that the first employee could verify me on the phone, the second did not verify me at all and the third needed me to click on link in my email (while calling the data is not working so I had no internet connection to click on the link - I explained her about the process with two other employees but she did not care). She put me through english department again and I had to wait 13 minutes with no success being transffered. I called for the 4th time and after again waiting around 10 minutes I got connected with en english department - finally!!! I got finally normal employee but the resolution was not satisfying at all. I wanted replacement but they could not do that, only refund. I did not agree with this but I had no choice.

3991,US,Amazon not so Prime anymore,"I have been a long time member of Amazon Prime. I used to place orders and always received them within 1-2 days. Once the pandemic hit, it apparently gave businesses an excuse to slack off on customer service. The 2 day guarentee changed to a 2 day approximate, and we would get items that ran a day or 2 late once a month or so. Back in August 2023 I ordered 2 laptops, not a cheap order it was about $2700. They were both ordered from the same amazon store and delivery to the same address. On day 2 one laptop arrived, but not the other. Although it was odd since they should have shipped together I let it slide since my account said it was delayed in transit to be delivered the next day. I contacted them on chat at the end of day 3 when it said delayed in transit again. They promptly lied to me and said it was in the system and would be dropped off on day 4. At the end of day 4 I was told after a very lengthy chat with 2 CS reps that ""they didn't know where the item was but not to worry this happens sometimes"" I told them I was going to be out of town on business over the weekend but the amazon store still had the item in stock saying it could be there the next day. They said they couldn't do that because the other one had shipped even though they didn't know where it was. They said there was nothing they could do just give it another day. So day 5 comes no delivery CS reps 5 and 6 both lie to me but I finally get CSR 6 a ""supervisor"" to ""put a stop on the order and refund my money withing 48 hours"" I ordered the same item from walmart+ and received it in less than 2 days. The refund that was supposed to be returned in 48 hrs took CS rep #7 on day 15 to finally process the refund.

That card is linked to a checking account I don't really use anymore so I was overdrafted and got a $30 overdraft fee from the bank. The bank wouldn't refund since the prime charge was legitimate so I went on to amazon's online customer service chat to see if they could help. One woman passed me to a supervisor named Fatima. Fatima apologized and said that she would refund August's charge to the card that shouldn't have been used and to make up for the $30 bank fee, she would refund me for June and July's charges as well. Obviously I was at that point a happy customer, until... Two weeks later and not one refund had been received. So I call this time, instead of using the online chat. I don't know the name of the man I talked to, but after placing me on hold twice, he lets me know that even though HE COULD SEE the convo I had with Fatima, he couldn't honor her promise because it was ""against policy"".

Plus, with Amazon prime I get free delivery, movie channels and music.  Order multiple flavors of Atkins Plus Protein Shakes (30 grams).  All drinks were arrived with the exception of the Strawberry.  Each flavor was in an amazon box, amazon prime tape with brown paper rolled to prevent the inner Atkins box from moving during shipment.  Previously, I was a victim of product tampering so I always check the box for any visual evidence of tampering.  All flavors with the exception of the Strawberry were in an inner Akins box that was glued and contained 3 4 packs of the shake.  The Amazon Prime outer box for the Strawberry was securely taped with no gaps.  It did not have any of the brown paper to prevent movement during shipment.  The inner Atkins box was taped versus side flaps glued.  Immediately noticed a lot of black spots on the Atkins box.  Opened the inner Atkins box and found more tiny black spots. The drinks were not in the 3 4packs but were in the box individually.  Tried to figure out what the heck and as soon as I started removing the shakes cockroaches ran out of the box disappearing in my Kitchen.  The black spots are cockroach poop.  The amount of poop in the box, the fact that the outer box was securely taped and the time from shipment to delivery they were not picked up in transit.  Amazon sent me the Atkins shake knowing it was opened and visually had a lot of cockroach poop on it.  Amazon customer service (CSR) keep repeating the same script in broken English taking a breath at the same time while reading the script.  They would refund the money.  Repeatedly I asked them to send me something to get rid of the cockroaches, pay for an exterminator or I would post on every website I could find that Amazon knowingly ships items with cockroaches and cockroach poop.  The CSR stated I couldn’t do it.  Call was ended with me saying watch me.  I have an AKC Cavalier King Spaniel who has an unplanned pregnancy thanks to my male AKC king Charles.  Spraying to not an option and I don’t want to endanger Princess or her babies.  Several exterminators were called and I was quoted a figure up to $200 to get rid of the cockroaches but declined treatment when I advised them of the pregnancy.

4026,US,Dissatisfied with Amazon's Recent…,"Dissatisfied with Amazon's Recent Policies and ServiceI have been a loyal Amazon customer for many years, but recent experiences have left me deeply dissatisfied with the company's policies and service. I want to emphasize that my dissatisfaction is not directed at any specific representative but is primarily related to systemic issues stemming from Amazon's new policies.​ Incorrect Items Received: On multiple occasions, I have received the wrong items in my orders. These mistakes not only caused inconvenience but also resulted in wasted time and resources as I had to arrange returns and replacements.​ Items Not Received and Police Report: One incident stands out where a package mysteriously disappeared. I had to file a police report due to the significant value of the missing items. This was an extremely distressing experience and raises concerns about Amazon's delivery and security measures.​ Items Delivered to the Wrong Address: I have also faced situations where items were marked as ""delivered"" but were, in reality, delivered to the wrong address. This forced me to engage in a time-consuming process to track down and retrieve my packages.​ Refund Delays: The most frustrating aspect of my recent interactions with Amazon has been the extensive delays in processing refunds. Waiting for 30 to 60 days for a refund is not just an inconvenience but also feels like a tactic akin to withholding customer funds.​ This pattern of behavior resembles actions taken by financial institutions to retain customers' money rather than providing satisfactory customer service. It is disheartening to witness Amazon, a company I once held in high regard, resorting to such practices.​ As a result of these recurring issues and my growing frustration, I have made the difficult decision to discontinue my patronage of Amazon. While I have enjoyed the convenience and variety of products offered in the past, the recent decline in service quality and the apparent disregard for customer satisfaction have left me with no choice.​ I hope that by sharing my experiences, Amazon will take the necessary steps to address these issues and improve its customer service. It is my belief that companies should prioritize customer satisfaction over all else, as loyal customers are the lifeblood of any business.​ In conclusion, I can no longer place my trust in Amazon as a reliable online shopping platform, and I will be seeking alternatives for my future purchases.",2023,09,September,2023,1.0,1.0,low

Amazon 'refund issued"" is shown on website, although the actual monies were never returned to me.(3) My credit card claims, on recorded lines, that Amazon says that the item was not returned.  This is false.  I provided (1) emails from Amazon employees stating that they had received the returned item, (2) provided tracking proving receipt of goods from vendor (3) showed screenshots from the vendor website showing carrier scan, vendor scan of goods received, and vendor ""refund issued"".(4) Amazon has alternately listed the refund (screenshots on different dates) as the amount of tax $31.16, (which is the amount of the tax for the item) and refund due $359.16 (combined amount of the subtotal and tax).  There is no explanation of why Amazon only issued the amount of tax to Capital One, but the fact that they did substantiates the fact that they received the item as a return.  I have screenshots which I sent to credit card company showing that the ""return has been issued"" for both 31.16 and 359.16 (which makes no sense), and this is listed as August 28, which is the same date as what is listed on the email from the employee.  It is now September 11, and I still don't have a refund for goods returned July 25.(5) Amazon refunded my card $31.16 which is just the amount of tax, which substantiates that the item was returned but doesn't explain why I was not refunded the subtotal of the returned item.  This is Fraud. I have reached out more than a dozens of times via recorded calls and emails, I have gotten nothing but robotic answers and form letter responses. I have spent untold hours on this.

I have spent literally hours on the phone with Amazon and Capital One and sent dozens of emails to both.  Capital One sent me a link which I sent back (ending 7849) On September 7, on a recorded line, the Capital One agent told me that the link they sent me would not suffice, and I would have to re-send all of the information.

The chat response was that the item had been damaged in transit and had been returned to Amazon. A refund was promised.10 days later with no sign of a refund I enquired again using chat. This time I was told I had to wait 2 more days before I could ask for a refund as the delivery time had not expired. What on earth? No point trying to talk reason with the person on their chat. It’s already been well over 5 days and, anyway, why make me wait longer when they have already confirmed the item was returned to them.",2023,09,September,2023,1.0,1.0,low

I argued with the Amazon customer service that I have been waiting for more than 75 days after paying in full and now can not simply cancel the order as since the price of the product as gone up very much. The Amazon customer service agent has then informed me to place a new order again and once it is delivered I could reach the customer service and get the refund for the price difference amount.[ Amazon CS promised that the new price - old price will be the amount I would get refund] for which I agreed.

I did so, but none of my neighbors had received anything either.I then asked the representative to investigate further and provide me with more information about what might have happened to my package. They told me that they would look into it and get back to me within 24-48 hours.It has now been over 48 hours since I first contacted Amazon, and I have still not heard back from them. I am very frustrated and disappointed with the lack of communication and resolution to this issue.Therefore, I am requesting a full refund for my order, as well as a resend of the item if it is still available.

Recently I have noticed that most of the deliveries from Amazon come in unmarked white vans or even cars and not in Amazon vans.I am afraid most of the drivers of these vans and cars are rude, disinterested in their job and really don't care. I have recently had one driver who having been extremenly rude to my wife left some very heavy parcels blocking a fire door instead of walking another three yards to leave them by my front door. When confronted by my wife his response was ""if you don't like where I've left them I'll come and take them away - I don't care"". My wife thinls he made a very rude gesture as he drove away but cann't be sure.Today I was expecting another heavy delivery. When it arrive in a plain blue van a young woman who, when she rang the bell to the main door of the flats, told me she would leave the parcels just insi8de the main door. When I told her that was not any good to me. she just got back in her van and drove of with my delivery. Within a couple of minutes I received a pre recorde phone message from Amazon Logistic saying they had been unable to make the delivery.Every day now the main entrance to our flats is littered with Amazon parcel that are just thrown in by the drivers who then just drive off without making any effort to deliver properly.Wake up Amazon and get your house into order.

Make sure to compare prices because if I have one complaint is the fact that Amazon is not always cheaper than in the stores .Honestly, I don't really expect it to be the cheapest because there is that added cost of shipping and for the convenience and I'm prepared to pay for that sometimes, and sometimes I'm not.

Once Amazon prime has been declined it should never again appear on a subsequent screen during the placing of that particular order.  What a nasty, horrible company to deal with.

I tried to solve case directly with Amazon but since very beginning they started repeating same message in different variants again and again to go to Police and report case...I didn't see any reason for that because it wasn't my fault but ok eventually I decided to go to police and waited for hours there ofc.- So I went to Police and provided Report to Amazon in official Croatian Police Report that can be only on Croatian because Croatian is only official language in Public institutions. I provided it to Amazon but Amazon ignored me and said it is not on English or Italian and their desired form, ignoring me further and said that they will not help me any more.- I reported also this missing phone to UPS and they finally UPS confirmed after investigation that there was not phone in the package and they said they will contact Amazon and pay insurance amount directly to Amazon (since Amazon hired them for transport and they can not refund me,they said they will to Amazon and Amazon should refund me...but no!).

I contacted Amazon with this information with hope that this will be finally solved and that I will be refunded but Amazon told again about this police report not on Italian or English and totally ignored my refering to UPS solved case and they agqin finished correspondence with...you are guessing... will not assist any more because Police report was not in Amazon requested form and language and will not refund me!!So Amazon will at the end earn money on this lost package from UPS insurance!

I had to click cancel about six time before the website would accept my cancel option.Even after I finally canceled, I was still reminded several times that I was about to lose my membership and to continue to the cancellation process. I understand that Amazon was recently sued by the FTC in June 2023 for making it difficult for users to cancel their Prime memberships. The FTC alleged that Amazon used ""dark patterns"" to trick consumers into staying subscribed.As a result of this experience, I cannot recommend Amazon Prime. In summary, Amazon Prime is not worth the hassle. The free shipping is the only real benefit, and the cancellation process is incredibly frustrating. I would recommend looking for a different online retailer with free shipping if you're not interested in the other Prime perks.",2023,08,August,2023,1.0,1.0,low

4390,IE,I cannot emphasise enough how deeply…,"I cannot emphasise enough how deeply disappointed and frustrated I am with Amazon Ireland. For small purchases? They might be adequate. But for anything above 100EUR? Forget it.Firstly, they couldn't even get a simple invoice right, despite multiple confirmations and assurances. And when they make a mistake? They leave you to deal with the aftermath. No refund was issued, their drivers obstinately refused to take back the item, and now I'm left with the headache of sending it back myself.Moreover, the lack of an import fee or a detailed invoice breakdown isn't just an oversight, it's potentially illegal. It's clear that they're cutting corners at the expense of their customers.And the customer service? A complete travesty. I'm not sure what kind of training, if any, their team and management receive, but it's clearly inadequate. Rude, unhelpful, and utterly incompetent would be an understatement.Given this experience, I'm not only cancelling all my Amazon services, including my Prime membership, but I'm also urging everyone across the UK and Ireland to seriously reconsider using Amazon. There are plenty of other providers who value their customers and offer transparent, reliable services.For your own peace of mind, steer clear.Order Number: 202-5433225-0173931.",2023,08,August,2023,2.0,1.0,low

4421,UA,The Shocking Experience,"In recent times, there have been numerous instances of account closures by e-commerce giant Amazon without any explanation or proper communication to the affected customers. These abrupt closures have left customers frustrated, confused, and feeling violated. A negative trend of unexplained account closures is observed, highlighting the negative impact on customers and questioning the ethical practices of a company that prides itself on customer-centricity. Many customers, like myself, have fallen victim to Amazon's sudden account closures. Without warning or prior notice, access to accounts that have been faithfully used for years is abruptly terminated. When attempting to log in, a message appears stating that the account has been closed, with an email notification supposedly sent. However, in numerous cases, customers claim to have never received any such email or any details on how to resolve the situation.Adding to the frustration, attempts to seek clarification from Amazon's customer support often go unanswered. It is only when customers create new accounts and reach out to support that they receive a response, albeit in a rude form. The response typically states that the account was closed for violating the terms of the Conditions of Use agreement. However, customers vehemently deny any wrongdoing and are left perplexed by the lack of specific reasons for their account closures.Account closures without proper explanation or justification raise severe concerns about customer rights. As loyal patrons who have spent years and significant amounts of money on the platform, customers have the right to transparency and fair treatment. The sudden termination of access to accounts, which may contain valuable digital assets such as e-books and audio files, feels like a betrayal of trust. The alarming trend of unexplained account closures by Amazon raises serious questions about the company's commitment to customer satisfaction and respect for customer rights.",2023,08,May,2023,1.0,1.0,low

Weeks turned to months that we waited for this box. We were being told there was a holiday in China and as soon as it was over, they would send the part. After about 7 months of calls and complaints, they talked us into buying another chair of higher quality for half price. $500. We ordered it and it was junk. It needed to be charged 3 times the first day and was so slow it was useless. We asked to return the items, and they would not send us return labels. We wanted our money back so we could buy a quality chair. After arguing for a while, we asked Amazon to step in. Speaking with these people we got a lot of wrong information. Every time I said something to them, I had to wait either 72hrs or a week for the seller to answer. They sent it to an A-Z department to settle this while I was told a number of times, I would get my money back.

At 4.30pm, not seeing anybody, I checked again, the driver was still at the same place and the delivery moved to 7pm, while he was still 2 blocks away….At 5.30pm, I see now the driver is in Simi Valley, CA  at an Amazon center location, 30 miles away from my house. I phone the customer service, who literally just says what I can read on my screen…. So not useful at all.The day after I go to this center in Simi Valley, CA where they tell me to go complain in Chatsworth, CA as they cannot help locally. Well ….the driver obviously stopped here and had the printer loaded in the van there. So why cannot they help ? Being now in Chatsworth , we check, and printer is tagged as ""missing"" in the system. We phone together Amazon customer service over the phone, same thing again, not useful at all, we are even told it is not missing and it will be delivered this same day for sure.Now today saturday 07/29/23, same status as 3 days ago. The information are not even updated on the tracking. I phone the customer service where I am being told to wait until the 11th of august (in 15 days) to ask for a solution if I have not been delivered in the meantime. After saying I didn’t agree , I did ask to speak to a supervisor, who finally told me literally "" I cannot do anything else and I will hang up"", that he did while I was continuing speaking.I phoned again 2 hours ago , after having selected ""cancel this delivery"" , and spoke to another lady to whom I explained the whole story. This lady, this time, was courteous but told me she cannot tell me anything about this sad situation and will escalate the issue….and I cannot even order another 1 at the same price that I ordered !Now if I check the delivery status, informations have magically changed :  I can read that I refused the delivery because the order was canceled before. What ??!!? So now Amazon is changing the story line ?To summarize , basically my printer was loaded in the van, the driver stopped 2 blocks away for a while and for any reason it did last, then he decides not to deliver me and goes back to the Amazon center 30 miles away. The van stays overnight and suddenly the printer is missing, but in the end it is me refusing delivery because the order was canceled !?!?Something is definitely wrong but it is being cover-up obviously. Leaving aside the fact I was hang-up by an Amazon associate representing the management, and all other associates telling me what I could read !As it is not an isolated case, aside from huge money losses (and in this case how is it handled with Epson…),  it says a lot about the ""Customer experience"" or ""Customer centricity""  mindset being practiced at Amazon:- customer being held hostage if the ordered item has suddenly disappeared- customer being hung-up if not satisfied- customer unsatisfied left unsatisfied- customer is not a priority, Amazon decides to hang-up as they don’t have any solution, and decides that you have to wait the period of time they decide- customer is being handled by low cost countries personal , just repeating what they learned and not customizing their answer to your own concern. In the end the service is more expensive, being paid for…..nothing except providing informations you already have on your screenObviously, Amazon is not set to handle expensive orders/ items that can suddenly disappear, and for which you can be held hostage for a while. I know now that I will prioritize Amazon for cheap items but not for pricier ones where I will go in a store, or order straight from more serious companies (bestbuy….).It was not like this in the past, so Amazon has taken definitely a wrong turn, probably being the result of short-term cash only oriented decisions.

I was THREATENED that if I sent it back without the photo first, the package might get ""lost"" and I wouldn't get a refund.I had ordered an Ipad Air and wanted it in Silver, and by accident ordered the color Slate Gray and when it came realized it was wrong color.  Called cus. serv. was told it had to be shipped back and not brought in, thought that agent was processing refund, but didn't called to get shipping info and the very, VERY nice CSA, (shall be called nameless for a reason) offered to send it back and when I tried to tell her what to write (that I got the wrong color, she told me not to say anything and now I know why.)  A few days later, my second order arrived, correctly ordered and the color was STILL wrong, starlight, instead of silver.  I wanted to  reorder again but this time I wanted to ask the sellers first  if they had the correct color, but on Amazon you have to use a chat bot and I didn't know how long it would take to get a reply, called them  to see if they could call sellers. Due to complications with the website, had to talk to a supervisor and for some reason, before they accept the return I would have to take a photo as proof, which I NEVER had to do and determine whether I could get a refund. I never had to go through that before EVER, and everyone I talk to doesn't want to explain why and just quickly hangs up. They must be getting a lot of negative feedback on this. After the initial conversation, I quickly started an online return WHERE item was accepted and should have just sent it back, but I foolishly called to ask why I needed to send photo when you don't have to send if you return it with online processing and was threatened that if I didn't send a photo first, they may refuse it at the warehouse and if it gets lost, I won't get my money back.  I don't know if they legally can do that, and even those it's a hassle I will send the photo, but I don't like the idea that they have to ""approve"" the return and the logic behind that if I didn't call in to ask what I wanted to originally ask, none of this would have happened, no need to send photos and no one I know has ever been asked to send photos. I read somewhere that I should not have said wrong item but item not as described (wrong color) and maybe that would have made a difference, but they wouldn't change it, I know now why the nice CSA told me not to give a reason which is why I won't name her, BE WARNED-if you don't want hassle don't buy in first place, but if you do return, do ONLINE only.The naughty part of me says take a photo of bricks that you got instead of a computer, who's to say that you didn't get it, you got the proof.",2023,07,July,2023,6.0,1.0,low

For my last order, tho I switched to USD Amazon unilaterally decided to charge my Revolut card in my local currency and not USD.Long story short Amazon immorally (and in the EU also illegally) pocketed 10 USD (2% from the order value) - now imagine how many billions they make from this practice that borders basically a scam.Also they're customer support is even worse than their stupid exchange rate scam - the callback doesn't do anything whilst on the chat you end up discussing with people with very limited use and understanding of the English language, that are rude and completely useless.As a conclusion I am very disappointed in Amazon's practices.",2023,07,July,2023,1.0,1.0,low

4523,US,"Delivery issue, customer service problems","I recently ordered a few items from Amazon.com.   The order was placed on Monday and was to be delivered by 8pm on Tuesday.  About that time I tracked the package to see where it was.  Amazon's tracking function indicated that the package was out for delivery and the visual graphic showed it to be very close to being delivered.   Checking again about 30 minutes later, the tracker indicated that the package was on its way but running late.  The next check informed me that the expected delivery date was as late as Saturday.  I was quite puzzled by this.  How could a package that seemed to be virtually on my door step suddenly be up to four days away?  I waited to see if the package would arrive the next day (Wednesday) before trying to contact Amazon.com.  It did not, so once again I tracked it.  This time, the package was was apparently not even out for delivery. Perplexed and frustrated,  I tried various avenues to contact Amazon.com to inquire about what had happened.

4553,US,Amazon Refuses To Honor Their Prime Member Agreement,"Amazon advertizes “Building a better future”. How, by cheating and lying to your customers? Its funny how my daughter can get an order to her house in two days and I live 50 miles from her and if I order the exact same thing it takes over a week to get to me and I am a prime member. The thing is I complained to customer service and when I was getting my orders in two days they suddenly went to taking a week. Amazon has no problems still charging me for my membership even though they refuse to fulfill their end of the agreement. That is nothing more than stealing. Amazon has joined in with the rest of these big companies and could care less about customer service. So what if a customer stops shopping, they will never notice. I asked customer service which warehouse my order is being shipped from and they said they didn't have that info. Yet last night I had a customer service rep tell me. How could she tell me if they don't have that information. The thing is, the rep that told me last night said I was shipped from the same warehouse as my daughter was. That tells me Amazon has marked my account to be shipped with a big delay in retaliation for me complaining. No other way to explain it considering I use to get my orders in two days and all of a sudden it stopped and add in the fact I am shipped from the same warehouse as my daughter and she can get the exact same order in two days. To hell with these big companies offering all these big discounts only to stop giving them and end up lying to their customers. Over the past 4 weeks I have been told no less than four times they were giving me a promo credit of $10 and was told that again tonight. My thing is when they give this to you it can never be seen by the customer. They say it will just show up on you next order that Amazon sells and ships. ell over the past four weeks I was never given credit from the promo money and when I asked the rep tonight what was my promo balance he said just the $10 he just put in there. That is why Amazon does not let you see the balance because most of the time it is really never given like they told you it would be and if for some reason they do they hope you forget about it and eventually they let it just disappear. Wake up folks, Amazon could care less about their customers. They will do what they have to, say what they have to just to get as much money as they can from you in exchange for as little as they can.

While I was doing this, the scammer entered fake bank details with my name on them and continued to order hoping probably that the ,,invalid payment details"" would prompt me to enter real ones. I successfully managed to change my password which seemed to stop any outside editing. The stores from where these orders were placed had just been created and had long word store names that were obviously fake. So Amazon, you have scammers creating fake shops, hacking into people's accounts and placing orders to their shops worth hundreds of pounds, do you not do any checking whatsoever on these before activating them? I had to fight a sea of bots before actually speaking to human beings, 1 who hung up on me, 2 passed me to other colleagues and another 2 that did not know how to help me. After I told them I was hacked I was told I would be contacted within 24h, after 1h I received a no-reply email stating the account seemed fine. I ended up having to do everything myself and when I tried to close down the account, an error message came up and I was unable to do so.

I can only think of someone/somehow accessing my account and ordering something for themselves - and sadly there's no customer protection for that, as it was proven to me. Probably that's why the bank didn't process the refund and instead sent me back to Amazon.Numerous times I've contacted them and explain again and again, only to be assured that this will be processed the right team and only to get the same no-reply email advising me to contact my back and ask them for refund.So I got tired and eventually told Amazon to just send me those items, so I can recover some loss at least.

Wrong. Weeks of back and forth via email and chat saying ""go through feedback manager"", which I did originally, it was declined, I reopened the case, and it was closed permanently saying they won't remove it. After weeks I finally spoke to someone on the phone who told me that no-one at all has the power to remove the feedback and I need to leave a public reply! (Which I already did might I add. You get robotic responses, no way humans are looking at these and responding, otherwise they have 1 brain cell between them.

De productcode, de foto’s, de omschrijving en de recensies hadden het over het artikel wat ik wilde bestellen, maar ik ontving een compleet ander artikel. Ik heb contact opgenomen met Amazon en het was een fout op de website. Ik kon het artikel terugsturen en bijna 2x meer uitgeven aan het juiste product. Let wel: de initiële prijs was wat er ook bij andere leveranciers als prijs stond.Dus, wij het artikel terugsturen. Geen reactie ontvangen van Amazon dat de retour is ontvangen dus maar achteraan bellen. uiteindelijk gevonden en op 27 mei is het verwerkt in het systeem.Ik verwachtte van een bedrijf als Amazon dat het geld, net als bij bol.com, meteen wordt overgemaakt aan de klant. Ze hebben het artikel ondergedompeld terug. Maar nee, we moeten een maand wachten. Want ja, een bedrijf wat € 2,7 miljard winst maakt, kan niet eens € 700,- aan een klant overmaken…Na een maand wachten nog steeds geen geld. Nu blijkt dat de betaling niet goed te zijn gegaan is. Kan weer 5-7 werkdagen duren. En wat zegt de klantenservice: dat is het beleid.Ik vind het te zot voor woorden dat een principieel bedrijf niet netjes met de klanten kan omgaan en de validiteit regelmatig retour sturen. Verwacht ook niet dat je gecompenseerd wordt. Je hebt gewoon pech.Jammer, heel erg jammer.=======Too badWhere to start.On the website we found an article for a nice price. The product code, the photos, the description and the reviews mentioned the item I wanted to order, but I received a completely different item. I contacted Amazon and it was an error on the website. I was able to return the item and spend almost twice the price on the right product. Please note: the initial price was what other suppliers quoted as a price.So, we returned the item. No response received from Amazon that the return had been received, so I called them. Eventually the article was found and on May 27 it was processed in the system.I expected from a company like Amazon that the money would be immediately transferred to the customer, just like with bol.com. They submerged the item back. But no, we have to wait a month. Because yes, a company that makes € 2.7 billion in profit cannot even transfer € 700 to a customer…After a month of waiting still no money. Now it appears that the payment did not go well. May take another 5-7 business days. And what does customer service say: that's the policy.I think it's crazy that a principled company cannot treat customers properly and regularly return the validity.

4835,CA,"Dear Amazon,sale used items for new items","Dear Amazon,I am writing to you today to express my concern about the recent trend of selling products as new on Amazon when they are actually used and open. I have personally experienced this issue on several occasions, and I am sure that many other customers have as well.In my most recent experience,I returns multiple items from Amazon. When I received my order package, were clearly used or open or broken. The packaging was open, and the product themselves were dirty and had scratches and broken on them. I was very disappointed, as I had expected to receive a brand new product if any other business would do that would be held responsible but amazon is above the lawThey are aloud to do falls advertisements I contacted Amazon customer service about this issue, and they were very helpful. They issued me a refund for the headphones, and they also told me that they would investigate the seller. However, I am concerned that this issue is not being taken seriously enough.I believe that it is unfair to sell products as new when they are actually used. This is especially true when the products are sold at a premium price. Customers who purchase these products are expecting to receive a brand new product, and they should not be misled.I urge Amazon to take this issue seriously and to take steps to prevent it from happening in the future. I believe that Amazon should require sellers to provide clear and accurate information about the condition of their products. Additionally, Amazon should have a system in place to investigate complaints about sellers who are selling used products as new.I appreciate your time and consideration. I hope that you will take my concerns seriously and that you will take steps to address this issue.Sincerely,Martin raby",2023,07,June,2023,7.0,1.0,low

I am hoping this will explain to Amazon that the only reason why they are as big as they are is their customer base. And we deserve better!I have been an Amazon Prime member for very many years. For most of that time, I have been very happy which is why I kept the membership. However, as of recent every purchase/order I place, especially those of the next day/one day variety, have not made it within the time frame posted on their product page. Only options for me are to wait and deal with it or request a refund. Which then requires me to take it to a facility to execute the return before I receive my credit or refund.During a recent interaction, I was told by the rep to visit my neighbors to see if the package was delivered to their home in error. Did I mention it was 9 PM?Part of the benefit of having the Prime account is provides members expedited shipping. If this has changed, why aren’t we being told and why do they continue to post on their website, next day or 1 day shipping?If they can’t hold up their end of the bargain, why should I?  At this point with everyone starting to set up online direct to consumer options, is Amazon the only place to shop?  Should I terminate my relationship with and cancel my Prime?",2023,06,June,2023,1.0,1.0,low

This time they will only offer a refund in 7-10 days once the blade is returned again set up return using royal mail collect. I did look for a feedback section on Amazon and I also tried their call back service, phone rang straight away, then when I selected option to talk to an advisor the call was disconnected.

They give you 5 days to prove you own copyright over your own books especially those published on another website or you use public domain content. When using public domain, they will request you for a signed document to prove you have exclusive rights to use the materials freely. It took a whole day to change one book's content because of this requirement from them. Everything I gave them was not accepted as proof. The issue is there is no way to prove a public domain content version of the World English Bible to them. All the sites that I found says it is public domain. If there was a better place to publish with all their benefits, I would choose that one over them. I just like that I can still get royalties when people read my ebooks and they have ads to advertise your books. I can distribute globally and people buy my books there more than other platforms. Otherwise, I don't like them. They are troublesome to work with. I heard others complain about their author experience with them.

5098,GB,Great until they're not,"There's plenty to like about Amazon when it works. They sell more or less everything, and lots of it can be with you by tomorrow. But, for a company that is declaring profits bigger than some national budgets, they could shave just a little off that to provide actual customer service, for those occasions when it doesn't simply go right. There simply is no way to get hold of them. If you try to begin a complaint, or ask a question, the site will guide you through a million useless questions, in the assumption that you can only have a problem that they have foreseen, and that you can be guided to an automated procedure. If you really persist, this experience will become circular, as you glimpse buttons that you think will help, but actually take you back to an earlier point in the process. Eventually, you may spot the very well hidden 'contact us' button that appears if you go round three times, and insist each time that your problem isn't listed. Sadly this contact is a chat that is -without wanting to offend those who man cheap call centres - far less intelligent than a bot. Today I had the issue that a number of Kindle books have gone from my library. When you're removing them from a device, one button says, ""remove download"" whilst another says, ""delete,"" and the latter actually removes the book clean out of your library on the Amazon server. No idea why this would even be a possiblity, let alone so easy to do, but someone in our family managed to wipe a massive chunk of our library whilst emptying a Kindle. It took me about 10 attempts to explain to the guy on the other end that this is even possible - after each attempt he sent me a link to my library, insisting that the books must be there if I bought them. Eventually he pretended the chat had been quiet for too long (5 seconds) and passed it off to someone whose English and knowledge of Amazon was even worse. After reviewing the whole thing again with him, and receiving the same patronisation, he assured me there was nothing that can be done. I told him this isn't correct because I know people who have done it, by virtue of getting a slightly better assistant. Then I provided him with the order number for one of the books that is missing, so he could see that there is still a receipt in my order history, but that the book no longer appears in my library. At this point he told me that Amazon only archive invoices for a year or so, so he wouldn't be able to see a record of the order. I explained that I was looking at the record of the order, by logging into my Amazon account, which resides on their servers, so this was clearly a lie. At that point he simply closed the chat window. Normally I wouldn't go to the trouble of venting somewhere about this, but it's now about the tenth such experience I've had. This one is arguably partly my fault (although there's really no reason to have an option to completely remove books from your library, and certainly not to make it so easily done), but usually it's a complete screw up on their part, and you're still dealing with someone who can just hang up if they don't feel like helping.",2023,06,June,2023,3.0,1.0,low

My VPN freezes and because i cant update , no VPN. There was almost 250mgs freed just with clearing the cache on the Amazon apps, but still not enough to update apps.  Amazon's solution is buy the expansion for memory.  So essentially they created a problem that requires you to buy, yet another product to fix the problem. But there is no way to keep the preload Amazon apps from also consuming the additional memory.  A little shady, but what you gonna do I guess.  Hppefully a comperitor will emerge that can capitalize on this crappy business practice. Kind of like Sony loosing their foothold on portable music devaces that allowed Apple to come in and dominate that field.  I definitely regret trading in my old firestick for $7.  Amazon, if you are going to flood the limited memory capacity for your apps, then increase the capacity front 5 gig to accommodate your desire to put apps on there that people don't want.

This Supervisor was HORRENDOUS!!! : After reviewing both suits again I do see that I did receive the size 18 however, I wanted to respond to this email in the hopes that someone higher up will see my review of your unprofessional and disgusting incompetent service.I will also be responding the below answer in the hopes that I can report you.You are incapable of handling customer’s in a human way and you do not comprehend the English language thoroughly which makes it literally impossible for you to assist a customer properly.Amazon needs to discontinue outsourcing to outside countries where 90 percent of the reps can not serve the customer because of their ability to respond with immediacy and correctly comprehend the inherit problem.  This is evident and something that customers in the US consumer market have to deal with.  There is not an issue for someone having English as a second language working in customer service; there is an issue with reps who clearly do not thoroughly comprehend English and while it could be a combination of this Supervisor just not giving a s*** about the customer in conjunction with the language barrier, either way this supervisor is ill-equipped and incapable of handling customer’s issues and flat out lied telling me there were no size 18s left when clearly the 18 was open on the website.  The reason I can confirm this is that then she changed her story and said oh yes there is one.This person has no business in customer service let alone as a leader for other reps.  She also is incapable of listening and not speaking over the customer.  I had to ask her several times to let me finish my thought and this is another issue that is very common when I speak with customer reps that are outsources they speak over the customer.  I also believe that is due to their lack of understanding when one sentence is ending and another is beginning due to the language barrier.HURRENDOUS SERVICE FROM THEA M.",2023,06,June,2023,4.0,1.0,low

I have never experienced such a bad experience with any company in my life! I wanted to make a gif for my boyfriend who lives in another country. His birthday was coming soon and I wanted to surprise him. Because I was saving up money and they weren't in my bank account I decided to just buy a gift card. I made my order for a gaming monitor selected as a gift.Everything was going well till I got an email saying that my account is on hold. I tried to call the service multiple times in German( because I bought it in Germany) and English. I have over 30 calls with Amazon service. The situation didn't get any better, I also didn't get any emails. The ones I sent get deleted or I get a response from their system, not a human! When I log into my account I get a message to check my email and I can't do anything else except log out. I have checked in other categories such as spam or archive... The only way to contact them is to call them.Throughout the call, I got different answers every time. After every call, I have to wait more than 72 hours and contact them back, wait again, the same thing over and over again. I even got asked multiple times for proof of the bought gif card with photos showing the receipt and the spend amount. Others said that I have done something against their terms of policy, although I have read them and explained that I haven't.Overall I wasted a big amount of money, didn't get any support, wasted hours trying to explain my situation to people who don't know what they are doing, destroyed my moods multiple times, and didn't surprise a special someone.",2023,06,June,2023,4.0,1.0,low

5227,US,Amazon delivery is getting really…,"I am writing this review to express my deep disappointment with Amazon's delivery service, which has proven to be increasingly terrible and far from cost-effective. It is truly baffling how one can place an order for a product, only to have it delivered at the very last minute. As a Prime subscriber, I had high expectations when I placed an order for a printer in the afternoon of the day before, expecting a smooth and timely delivery process. However, my experience quickly turned into a frustrating ordeal.The delivery time for my order was changed multiple times, causing significant inconvenience. It went from an initial estimated time of noon to an ever-shifting schedule that ultimately settled on 7.15 PM the next day. Throughout the entire process, I had to wait anxiously, as the delivery time continued to be revised. It is truly disheartening to witness such a lackluster level of service from a company that prides itself on efficiency. The entire day was put on hold as I eagerly awaited the arrival of my order.What makes matters worse is the fact that the delivery time extended all the way until 10 PM, and yet, I am still here waiting. This constant rescheduling and prolonged waiting period have only added to my frustration and dissatisfaction. It has become evident that the convenience I expected from Amazon's Prime service is simply not worth the trouble.I can't help but compare this experience to that of a third-world service, as the level of inefficiency and unreliability is truly reminiscent of subpar delivery systems. It is worth mentioning that since Amazon's unionization, the quality of service seems to have taken a noticeable downturn. While I understand that various factors can contribute to delivery delays, the continuous changes and lack of punctuality are simply unacceptable.I hope this review sheds light on my disappointing experience and highlights the urgent need for improvement in Amazon's delivery service. I trust that Amazon will take these concerns seriously and strive to regain the trust of its customers by delivering on its promises of timely and efficient service.",2023,05,May,2023,2.0,1.0,low
5228,US,Amazon delivers what I want consistently well,"Hello. My bride and I order from amazon on a regular basis. Searching for what I want is easy, and the reviews are helpful when deciding on whether to purchase or not and I’m on the fence regarding a product. Returns are easy when dropping off an item at a return center. Just do the return request online, they send you a bar code and you just drop off the item and they scan your phone. Done. Thirty seconds. Don’t even need a box or anything. Prime membership is worth it to me when it comes to the shipping, and prime also comes with the amazon prime tv and I’m certain there are more perks that other people use that I don’t even use that are included with the prime membership. There have been times when something didn’t arrive on time as planned, and the story I’m telling myself is that even the best systems and processes will not be executed perfectly every time. So it is what it is. And I choose to appreciate that the majority of the time, I get what I want and it’s delivered properly as it should be. Well done amazon drivers. Well done amazon customer service. Well done Jeff Bezos. Well done amazon sellers.There are times when I think, I need to go out and go shopping. There are times when I think, I can so order that amazon and get on with my day and focus on other stuff. I like that I can purchase gifts, have them  wrapped, shipped, etc. and bada bing bada bang. Done with a few taps on my phone.Many small business owners and local mom and pop shops may get jacked and may not be able to compete. That’s a challenge everyone needs to overcome.

I called 5 times the other day trying to get an American and couldn't.Before if they caused me a lot of time and stress they would give me a promotional credit. Today on live chat he said he can't do that. He wasn't even aware it could be done.Also, almost every item I have purchased and there's been a lot, has been defective. Chips in glass, scratches on pans and now spoon rests, broken plastic, hard pillows, and the list goes on.Even some of the sellers aren't responding to my messages anymore.And their listing says no import fees, and YET I'm charged import fees. Lastly, once AGAIN I go to a page to look at the reviews (most are fake if you didn't know) and I see reviews for a totally different product. This is the 3rd or 4th time I've encountered this in the last 2 years. It stresses me out because I have no idea which review is for what, or how many there are in total. The site is completely screwed up in more ways than one.I never loved Amazon, but now I hate them.Note: that everything about the economy worldwide is imploding. Almost every company I used to deal with has taken a dive since the scamdemic started.Again, this is no coincidence.",2023,05,May,2023,44.0,1.0,low

Now in order to get the discount... I'm supposed to send it back and order another one? In what mind is that good for anyone? Amazon would have a returned product worth less, and I would have to go through the logistics hassle... okay, maybe UPS would win with this stupid policy.I insist, it's a product where Amazon is the merchant. I would see it totally justified if the customer was hopping between vendors in their marketplace. That's not the case.I really regret not using Best Buy for this. I also stopped using Amazon when I'm in other countries, and it's not that difficult finding alternatives for many products. After leaving Amazon, some other niche products can be a PITA to find, though... specially if (like me) one has sworn off Aliexpress as well...But life goes on without Amazon.

5295,US,"Horrible, horrible customer service","My husband requested a phone call from Amazon this morning to address the latest delivery issue we're having with them.  It was a computer call, but relatively easily he got to an actual person.  Unfortunately, the first woman he talked to said she was putting him on hold then transferred him to someone else without telling him.  Then the second woman did nothing but tell him what the shipping status was, which he already knew from looking at the website.  He told her that he already knew what the status was because he was looking at it online.  The shipping status, for an overnight order, was updated yesterday (the day it was supposed to be delivered) and still hasn't been updated again.  We live in DFW, and the package was one suburb away when the update to ""delayed in transit"" was put up on the Amazon website.  The status is still delayed in transit, dated yesterday.  He was trying to find out when we will actually receive the package.  The second representative, although if I was Amazon I would use that term lightly about her, told him that customer service is unable to contact the fulfillment center to find out where our order is.  I honestly don't believe that for a second.....Amazon personnel have the ability to contact Amazon personnel at other facilities, I've had them do it for me before without any issues.  The only thing she offered to do is to put a request in the system that our order be delivered tomorrow, 2 days late.  And it would just be a request, not a guarantee that the package will actually be delivered.  My husband asked why it couldn't be delivered today, even though it would still be late, which is when she said they can't contact the facility we know the package is at.  My husband told her that there is no feasible reason that customer service can't contact any of their fulfillment centers directly and talk to someone.  At this point we were both highly frustrated by the run around from them.  She told him she was going to put the request for delivery tomorrow in and that's all she was doing.  She was being completely unhelpful and he finally told her so.  She started raising her voice and said ""Oh, so I'm not being helpful huh?  Well then bye,"" and hung up on him.  I listened to the whole thing because he had speaker phone on.  Refusing to do anything to help the situation, the complete inability to deal with a customer, and then actually hanging up on said customer after yelling at them.  This sort of behavior is completely unacceptable.  Now we don't even know if she actually put in the delivery request, the shipping status remains unchanged, and we don't have any idea where to go with our original issue, the shipping status, or who to talk to to report her incredibly unprofessional behavior.  I'd give Amazon customer service a zero star rating if I could.  We're in exactly the same boat we were in when he called, except now he's been yelled at and hung up on.

5298,NZ,Beware of Overseas Purchases and Unresolved Refunds with Amazon,"My experience with Amazon's customer service has been deeply frustrating and disappointing. I purchased a product which turned out to be defective, and since then, I have been caught in a loop of miscommunications and delays while seeking a refund for the return shipping costs.I had to shell out $180 NZD to return this faulty product. According to Amazon's policies and the Amazon Renewed Guarantee, this cost should be fully refundable. Despite numerous attempts to resolve this, it feels like I'm wrestling with a gigantic corporation that seems bent on ignoring my legitimate concerns.If you're considering making a purchase from overseas on Amazon, I'd strongly advise against it. In the event the product is faulty, you might find yourself spending a significant amount of money to return it. Even worse, Amazon may employ a strategy that leaves you feeling disheartened: making you communicate with numerous unhelpful individuals, passing the buck between departments, and forcing you to repeat your situation over and over with no end in sight.This whole ordeal has been extremely unsettling and exhausting. The absence of professionalism, customer care, and straightforwardness has pushed me to escalate this issue to the New Zealand Commerce Commission.I'm sharing my story not only to seek a resolution for my situation but also to warn others about the potential difficulties they may encounter in a similar scenario.

5306,IN,An Honest Review of Amazon,"An Honest Review of Amazon I have been an Amazon customer for several years now, and I believe it's time to share an honest review of my experiences with the e-commerce giant. While Amazon offers numerous advantages and convenience, it also has its fair share of drawbacks that need to be acknowledged. Here's my breakdown of the pros and cons:Pros:1. Vast Product Selection: One of Amazon's biggest strengths is its unparalleled product range. From electronics to clothing, home goods to books, you can find almost anything you need on their platform.2. Competitive Prices: Amazon's marketplace fosters competition among sellers, often resulting in competitive prices. You can often find great deals and discounts on various products.3. Convenience and Speed: Amazon's Prime membership offers fast and free shipping on eligible items, making it incredibly convenient for time-sensitive purchases. Additionally, their user-friendly interface and seamless checkout process enhance the overall shopping experience.4. Customer Reviews: The abundance of customer reviews provides valuable insights and helps make informed purchasing decisions. It's beneficial to hear others' experiences before making a purchase.Cons:1. Counterfeit Products: Due to the sheer number of sellers on Amazon, there is a risk of encountering counterfeit or low-quality items. While Amazon takes measures to combat this issue, it remains a concern for some buyers.2. Third-Party Seller Discrepancies: As Amazon allows third-party sellers, inconsistencies in product quality, customer service, and shipping practices can occur. It's essential to research sellers and read reviews before making a purchase.3. Environmental Impact: The rapid growth of Amazon's operations has raised concerns about its environmental impact, such as packaging waste and carbon emissions from delivery vehicles. They have made some efforts to address these concerns, but there is still room for improvement.4. Worker Conditions: Over the years, there have been reports and controversies regarding the working conditions at Amazon's fulfillment centers. These issues highlight the need for better worker treatment and labor practices.Overall, Amazon remains a convenient and popular platform for online shopping, but it's important to approach it with awareness of its limitations. Being an informed shopper and understanding the potential drawbacks can help mitigate any negative experiences. Amazon's continuous improvements and addressing of these concerns would undoubtedly contribute to a better customer experience and make it an even more reliable platform in the future.",2023,05,August,2022,11.0,4.0,high

The exercise machine- we could see before it entered our home, that it was going to be damaged because the box was falling apart.Again, we took pictures and called Amazon immediately.Here’s the issue (besides spending a lot of money to be delivered damaged products) YOU GET STUCK WITH LAGER HEAVY ITEMS cluttering your home until/if Amazon graces you with a pickup.We still don’t have a pickup date for the broken furniture and the Amazon customer service rep had the nerve to say to me, “Be careful who you order from” meaning it’s a third party seller… But it’s through Amazon! So shouldn’t the company be keeping tabs and quality control of the sellers?We were basically blamed for buying through Amazon BY Amazon customer support!Now we have large heavy garbage in our house that we’re stuck with until Amazon comes to remove it AND we don’t get a refund until the broken item has been returned to where it came from.So if you like spending a lot of money to be greatly inconvenienced and you love having your home filled with clutter- you’ll enjoy ordering large items from Amazon.Also- the customer service rep didn’t even seem interested in filling a complaint with whoever Amazon is hiring to deliver heavy items in our area, so they’re just going to allow more products to get smashed and more customers to have to endure the inconvenience.",2023,05,May,2023,1.0,1.0,low

I must emphasize that my experience with Amazon's customer service has been nothing short of abysmal.On June 14, 2023, I placed an order for a monitor as my girlfriend had to fly into the UK due to a family emergency. Unfortunately, my mother had been taken to the hospital, and my girlfriend needed to work remotely, which necessitated the urgent purchase of the monitor. Understanding the urgency of the situation, I relied on Amazon's reputation for reliable and efficient delivery services.However, to my utter dismay, the monitor failed to arrive on the promised delivery date. Frustrated and concerned, I immediately contacted Amazon's customer service on Sunday, June 15. I expressed my extreme dissatisfaction and disappointment, highlighting the urgency of the situation and the need for the monitor to be delivered promptly. I vividly remember expressing my hope that I would not be having the same conversation with your representatives the following day.Much to my disappointment, not only did I receive no resolution or explanation, but I also did not receive any response from Amazon regarding my concerns. It is profoundly disheartening to witness such a lack of professionalism and disregard for customer grievances. I find it incredulous that Amazon would send several delivery updates only to fail to deliver as clearly outlined.Moreover, the lack of accountability and responsiveness from Amazon's customer service department is simply unacceptable. It is as if your customer service team operates on the moon, far removed from the realities of timely deliveries and customer satisfaction. The inability to address my concerns, coupled with the repeated failed deliveries, has left me both profoundly disappointed and infuriated.As a long-standing customer, I have come to expect a certain level of service and reliability from Amazon. However, this recent experience has shattered my confidence in the brand. I implore you to rectify this situation immediately by ensuring the prompt delivery of my monitor today. Additionally, I request a formal explanation for the repeated delivery failures and an apology for the lack of response from your customer service team.If this matter is not resolved satisfactorily, I will have no choice but to reconsider my future purchases from Amazon and share my unfortunate experience with friends, family, and on various online platforms.

Took several weeks and dozens of e-mails, chats, and phone calls to get that situation resolved. Now that they've finally found my house, we're having horrible trouble with deliveries. Amazon needs to stop with the “Uber Eats” model of delivery. I can wait a couple days for my packages! And, at the very least, stop sending drivers out at 4:30 in the morning! Seriously. Stop that: Nobody needs their package at that time of day!! Choosing ""Amazon Day"" isn't always an option - which is super annoying - AND, even when I DO chose that as the delivery option, items are delivered willy nilly anyway. So, really, what's the point? Almost every time we have an issue with a driver, it’s a contractor in a private car. We’ve had drivers racing down our gravel road, we had an underage deliverer driven by his mom deliver a package, had items not arrive at all, items misdelivered, items in the same order arriving in multiple shipments IN THE SAME DAY, and had an uninsured driver with expired tags get stuck on our road while trying to deliver at an unnecessary time of day using ridiculous GPS instructions that he shouldn't have followed in the first place. This is all in the last 2 weeks!! Amazon's vetting process for these drivers seems sketchy at best, and I'm not even sure anything is validated! Safety is Amazon's priority? Nope!

They also removed from my account this grocery order which I find strange. Almost to erase their wrong doing. It seems like I’m being accused of submitting false information to what was received from their delivery personnel . Would you eat a product that was cut open where the seal was.? Or cherry tomatoes or their chicken breasts where the product wrapping was opened and the bag it came in plus the product wrapping had juices leaking all over my steps and floors in my home.? I was notified three hours later from the time the delivery was supposed to have arrived that my items will not be delivered. No explanation why. I have been a customer of Amazon for years and have purchased over $100,000 in products. Other problems I have encountered (as stated above) recently is opened packaging, crushed packaging all containing food products like potato chips, their coconut cream pie, cherry tomatoes, etc. I asked for a credit on my balance and I received it but I feel they are now retaliating against me because of the no show of my order and giving me a credit then charging me again for the same amount of the credit which is now harassment and I’m thinking of suing them over 65.00 in grocery products for their actions. It’s not the money but the principle. My lawsuit will be  10 million including punitive damages. It seems like they don’t believe my claims of how their products arrived.

5436,CA,Amazon Has Done Terrible Things To Me,"Amazon Has Done Terrible Things To Me. I have been an Amazon Prime Member for 12 years now. At the beginning their customer service was excellent and I even got their credit card. This past year, however, they have become a nightmare to deal with and have stolen money from me and permanently banned me from writing reviews because of ""suspicious activity"" on my account. Let me be clear, I have left maybe 3-4 reviews the entire 12 years I've had my account, and I only reviewed something if it was a terrible product and I tried to save others from buying it.Furthermore, I ordered a Razer Monitor a few months ago, and the package was ripped open when it arrived. I tested the monitor and it was not the model I ordered, so I sent it back. Shortly after I received an email stating that I was not getting a refund and they were keeping the monitor I sent back. This was a $1200 monitor, so I lost a lot of money. I tried going through the Better Business Bureau and Amazon laughed in my face and said they would be happy to speak to my legal team. Most recently I ordered 3 Limited Edition Nintendo Switch Tears of the Kingdom models, and they were stolen off my porch. I have specific delivery instructions I have left Amazon, that they are to knock and if no one answers to deliver another time, to make sure my packages didn't get taken by porch pirates. Well, they refused the refund without a Police Report, which I did. Even after the Police investigation was done and the Police Report was approved, I sent it to Amazon as instructed. They still denied me a refund or replacement, so I had to call and argue with them and they finally agreed to the refund. Amazon in its current state is a complete mess and they no longer know how to care for their long-term customers who have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on their platform over 12 years. Stay away from this company if you can and order from other online retailers, as places like Walmart and BestBuy Online are stocking the same products now and they have much better delivery and customer service.",2023,05,May,2023,1.0,1.0,low
5437,US,Stop the bait and switch listings and fake reviews everywhere,"They need to stop the 2 types of bait and switch that is going on in the majority of listings before they get sued into oblivion because of how rampant this issue is and how much it is costing people. The first issue is when you see a product for instance “3 pack diamond grit polish $10.28” in the search results and then you click on it because it’s a good deal and then it shows you the horizontal row of “different sizes” but the exact item/size/title/description just the literal exact thing that it was advertising before you clicked on it says it’s $32.98 and the only “size”/the only product on that listing for the listed $10.28 is a piece of wool cloth. This is flat out ridiculously stupid and scummy and a waste of everyone’s time. The second and even worse thing is sellers will start selling a good product and once it gets good reviews or if they can no longer get that product or whatever they will simply delete the photos, title, and description of the original product and then replace it with a new product that is often in the same category or related to the original product but far worse quality and almost never even interchangeable with the original (for example they replace a belt sander with a palm sander or drill or just different size brand and quality belt sander) and all they did was change the title, description and photos but kept the same listing since all they technically did was “edit it” which also allows them to keep all the positive reviews so you will be buying a product that is rated 5 stars and had hundreds of reviews and thus probably won’t even question it but yet you may be the first person to ever buy it because in essence they’re all fake reviews since they’re for the other product. The only way to tell is by reading the reviews and even then unless it has dozens of reviews or reviews with pictures of the product you’ll never know. Not only is that scummy and definitely worthy of a class action it could also really cause severe harm to people physically and monetarily because a lot of people get a lot of tips and info on the use, maintenance, parts, and accessories of products from the reviews especially on Chinese products that have useless instructions. For instance, with 3d printing a lot of cheap and popular printers are from Chinese companies and come with poor instructions and if you don’t know what you’re doing it’s rough so say for instance someone says that they a hard time finding a thermister or heating element for the printer but XYZ is the correct one, well in 3d printing and especially with those parts if you don’t replace them with the correct ones and in the correct way you can easily start a fire and so if they change out the product and keep the reviews then some mom buying one for her kid won’t know any better and even doing all the research if she sees that review she could she will end up installing the wrong one and there is a high likelihood that it will catch on fire all because Amazon couldn’t care less about anything but profit, and no I’m not one of the eat the rich types but corporations are getting out of hand and this stuff is not only poor business practices and scams blatantly happening on a massive scale right in front of them it’s also 100% going to get someone killed.",2023,05,May,2023,4.0,1.0,low

I signed up for a trial Prime subscription and decided to buy some items for my home since I had just moved in. My first purchase wasn't very large, at 800 euros, but then I decided to buy everything I needed all at once, so I wouldn't have to split my delivery into parts. That's why I chose to pay several times more but get everything I needed immediately. My bank declined the transaction because they requested confirmation that it was me making the payment in order to approve such a large amount for spending. While I was dealing with the bank, Amazon blocked me because they considered it suspicious activity.Perhaps I wouldn't have written a review just because of this, but it was only the beginning. Because as soon as I wanted to confirm my identity with Amazon so they could understand it was me, Amazon did absolutely nothing. After blocking my account, they wouldn't let me contact customer support through the account because the account was suspended, even for communication with customer support. They asked me for documents from my bank and information that I had provided in my account. I did that, and they replied that it was not enough information and requested the same thing again. This has been happening in an endless loop. I have provided exactly what they asked for, sometimes even trying to provide more detailed information, but they still continue to ask me for the same information every day. Moreover, when I call customer support, they say they are not competent in matters of account suspension and that the department responsible for unlocking accounts is not directly accessible through a call, only through the bank information they request from me.It turns out they constantly ask for the same thing and then respond that there's not enough information. And no one can tell me what the hell they are missing.

The first representative told me that they couldn't get in contact with the driver and asked me to try - I couldn't contact the driver either. They then said they were going to refund the order. I agreed. Later they said that the driver was ""in my area"" and would be no later than 4pm ""Max"".Due to the cost of living I didn't have the budget to go and buy more food so I only had the option to take more time out to wait in for the delivery.It didn't arrive by 4pm.I then contacted customer services again who told me that a FREE replacement would be sent out by midnight the same day. After a very long wasted day, time taken off work and an autistic son waiting to be fed, the replacement order arrived by 11:30pm.Today Amazon has taken the payment of £40 despite promising a full refund of the order.I contacted customer services again today and that representative told me that I would be charged the £40 and there was nothing that could be done about it.This has caused stress for both me and my son. I have written to customer services on the email address they provided but that was a few days ago, and they haven't even acknowledged receipt of my email. Needless to say I won't be ordering food from them again and will likely cancel my Prime membership also. Don't bother buying a Prime membership. Doesn't make a shred of difference tbh.

I took the original, unopened package to the UPS store and was told I had to ""PAY"" for another shipping box because the original box was not ""STURDY"" enough.  Funny...the USPS thought it was sturdy enough when they originally picked it up, shipped it and delivered it to me.  With a cost of almost half the estimated refund I would get from Amazon in return shipping fees for re-packing and re-boxing the item, I canceled my return.  With the money for gas and the money I must spend to get the item returned to Amazon, it isn't worth my time or effort.  BEWARE what you purchase with Amazon.

Chased up and was told I hadn't followed the process which in fact I had, the to the letter.  New delivery arrived in February and only 2 of the 10 boxes arrived again. Called them again to complain about A: not refunding my original postage B: How can they make the same mistake twice.  Was told to return the boxes again and they would refund me.  I was not going to get caught out on that again and told them about the first incident. I have sent no fewer than 30 emails and asked for this to be escalated to someone who can fix the problem. They won't escalate. I cannot speak to a manager or supervisor.  This is a faceless company who are great when they get it right, but when they get it wrong they don't want to resolve matters.  Absolutely shocking customer service. They should be ashamed. I have lost money and still do not have my product ordered in November 22.",2023,04,April,2023,13.0,1.0,low

The reason why I am writing this experience everywhere  I can is to rise awareness on the level of theft that happens in 2023!!!! I doubt that package left the Amazon warehouse unlabelled and if so, how did the driver know where to delivery it ???? The facts are very simple, and the driver knew what he was doing not caring a damn in the world that he is seen, nobody will do anything, and the “ item” now in someone’s house will be marked as “ lost” . Such a shame I can’t post the pictures too in here …. What Amazon does? Apologies and a refund is issued, the review i wrote on their website it’s not made visible. So, how can you trust buying electronics or more expensive items from Amazon when the people who work with them steal customers goods?????

I know getting a refund or sometimes a replacement if you're lucky to get a replacement fast at least with me it had been easy. That was when I used to live in apartments not anymore. Now, issues with orders? No, I always get what I want even without prime I got what I ordered but of course I had to wait for it. I ordered two chest binders for myself, it was easy to return one & repurchase a second one. Never got anything used or broken, I mean shampoos or liquid soaps always tend to leak & I wish it was more protected from leaking but I guess it can't be helped. I did for a fact have a family member who has had issues with returns. Don't know if it's the sellers being scammers, but whenever you do return something always keep the tracking receipt from UPS or USPS because even though you did return everything sometimes you'll get your money taken as if you never returned it. Then you get an email threatening you about your money being taken because the sellers ""never received the items"" so always keep your tracking numbers & take pictures of your returns. Sometimes calling customer service is useless, I always go for the chat it's easier & faster in my opinion.

Recently I placed an order and canceled in the same day. Amazon refunded the money that they had charged me from their fulfillment center, but I actually had to call and find out why the second party seller had not refunded the money. Amazon sent an email to the seller after 72 hours. There was no response. Amazon‘s policy is to refund the money. I called Amazon and filed a complaint. They gave me the card member service center. The agent told me and I quote we never charged you for that money. Yes that’s what I said they told me they never charged me for either of the charges . I told him that’s funny because I’m looking at my bank account and I can see both charges the one for $39 the other one for $25. I also can see a week later that you guys refunded the $39 but I filed a complaint with you guys and you had to file an email with the second party seller to get that money. He insisted that they never charged me the money. Then he said they refunded the money  so I said so how was it? You’re telling me one minute ago that you guys never charged me for either of the products and now you’re telling me that you refunded them both? I said I think that you’re lying to me trying to cover your ass. So I had to go to my bank my bank put a hold on it and the money has already cleared now I have to wait and fight for $25.17 from Amazon  highly disappointed but not that a billion dollar  company gives a crap about one persons $25 that they “never took, and then “refunded it, but they never took it  .

5671,PE,Beware when you buy a USD 300 + item,"After being a Prime member for years and always receiving a daily good service, the day arrived when I was not only let down but mistreated by a Amazon Customer Service representative.Sadly I placed an order on March 23rd for a watch that cost USD 450 aprox. I kept receiving messages the delivery was running late until I received a message I should ask for a refund. Why didn’t the refund it automatically I never understood but now I do.To ask for a refund you have to return your item. How can I return something I never received ? The only option is cancelling the delivery (even if it’s days late) and it can be cancelled by the seller (Amazon) or the client, since I was not the seller I had to do it as the client. After that I could only ask for a refund. I called before and I was told that was the method.  By chat the representative told me the item was going to be “delivered tonight” and I asked “you mean in the next 4 hours because it’s already 8pm” and the answer was yes.The following day after not receiving the item I did what I was told. I couldn’t wait longer because I was visiting the US and was flying back to my country. The strange thing is that they told me it was “undeliverable” which is impossible because I was staying in a 5star hotel with 24/7 service and front desk receiving packages. Amazon sent me a code to be given when delivered and I gave it to the hotel. They never arrived to deliver anything nor requested a code. I confirmed that with the hotel. But it’s funny because in 6 days I received at least 10 other orders from Amazon, never missed or lost 1 single order. So “undeliverable” was not accurate.It’s April 12th and still haven’t received anything, the watch or the refund. They told me it was undeliverable and then they told me it was damaged but “since you cancelled the delivery” now I have to wait 30 days for it to be returned to Amazon for my refund.It was never in my hands and I cancelled because they told me to do it but now it’s their excuse for having me wait until they decide.Meanwhile I have had to pay the bank for the USD 450 charged to my credit card.I have chatted 4 times and talked over the phone 1 time with Customer Service Representatives, this lady whose name is Cha. She was rude, arrogant and 0 willingness to help.. just told me I have to wait 30 days and that’s it. I asked if I can talked to somebody else and she told me she was going to hang the phone… 2 times.What can I do ? It’s impossible to get to Amazon, nobody understands the issue.I am responsible for whatever Amazon sold, they decided which carrier to use, they didn’t deliver the order, haven’t sent it back yet BUT everything is about me. They have already charged me but won’t give the money back.A disaster. They work well with sells under USD 300 but more than USD 300 just beware.I have the terrible feeling I won’t see my USD 450 back. Very bad Amazon !!",2023,04,March,2023,3.0,1.0,low

Recently I got tangled up with a scammer that asked me to order apple gift cards from my Moms and my account. So Amazon blocked those accounts and really put me through the wringer trying to keep them open and state my case. They kept asking me to submit proof of the cards I was using and billing statements from the bank. Which I did to know avail. We lost all the Kindle books we’ve purchased over the years and both being avid readers that’s a lot of money, all the movies we’ve purchased on those accounts customer service told me they couldn’t be transferred. We would have to create a new account and repurchase. I finally created my mom a new account with a new email and I told her if I wanted something I’d just use her account.

An hour later she gets an email stating that they have put her account on hold due to suspicious activity…what suspicious activity? Since when is a movie and a charging cable suspicious activity? I was supposed to send them a copy of our bank statement and proof that we were the owner of the debit card used which I did. Only to get another email saying that what I provided wasn’t good enough. They wanted information on a credit card ending in 5719 but we don’t use credit cards on that site. I called the account change and issue department 800.388.5572 if anyone needs it and I was told that an email had been sent to them and they would respond within 24 hours. What sucks about a account being blocked is you can’t access anything, you can’t make orders, listen to music, watch videos you own or have rented your just dead in the water. All I can say about this is if everyone is being treated the same way I’m being treated they are going to lose customers fast. I’ve also had packages come to me opened, I’ve had things I’ve bought come broken. It’s taken a long time to get things refunded and or replaced. What is it about the bigger the company gets the worse they treat the people that made them successful to begin with? It’s the same with Wal-Mart.",2023,04,April,2023,1.0,1.0,low

5682,US,Amazon Don't Always Refund Money Timely,"I don't want to be negative about a company I could trust. But this is about valuing your customer when a mistake has occurred. I ordered a Cell Phone in December from Amazon it arrived on the 11th of December. I returned the phone on December 16th according to the return rules. I called after about 14 days. Then they told me I had to wait up to 30 days to expect my refund back to the debit card. Which I think is excessive waiting time. at the end of the 30 days, I was on hold for at least 10 minutes and because of work, I was forced to hang up. The next day I traveled to work, for seven days. when I returned I tried to follow up again they ask me for information that I didn't have at the time. So another thirty days go by.  I called today and a  very nice lady help resolve the issue but told me that would have to wait an additional 14 to 30  days for a refund although it had a process. I found that behavior unacceptable. That means they had my money from December 11th until late April. Let's say roughly 12 weeks, at 5% interest for $879.00 equals $43.95 times 3 equals $131.85. When I mentioned this to the nice lady her tone changed and then said there is nothing they can give me except they are sorry for the delay in payment. Well, in my business if I feel like a customer is not happy with my service I make a reasonable offer such as a discount or a refund because if you are a good customer; who can afford to lose good customers? Amazon can! well, like a said I don't want to put down a vendor just because they made one mistake. But they would still have my money if I didn't call today. No go checks and balance systems. I am quite sure this is not the first or last time. But check your Amazon account for your refunds. As a punishment to Amazon for the next 90 days I will not make a purchase with them. That is the only power I have. They offer me a 10-day gift certificate and because I protested they gave me 20 dollars. It is from thank you but no interest to, a 10-day gift certificate to 20 dollars. Plus they lose my money for the next 90 days",2023,04,April,2023,2.0,1.0,low

Next day I find out that I need to wait 15-30 DAYS till they receive the package back and then 3-5 BDAYS to issue the refund and then 3-5 BDAYS to get my refund. So I have to wait for a month to get my goddamn money back because of them not doing their job. And the only thing that could say is “I’m sorry”. Hate Amazon.

5687,US,Amazon has got WAY downhill.....,"1. I researched online, and Amazon has upwards of 60 to 70% Asian sellers now (USA site): It's ridiculous - their clothing size measurements are often WAY off (a small in a shirt was 53"" in the bust! I wear an XL and have a 45"" bust); they often don't list the fiber content at all (one item was listed as 100% cotton AND 35% polyester); If you don't read carefully, your item(s) could take a month+ to get because they're shipped from China!; The BROKEN ENGLISH in MOST of product descriptions is absolutely ridiculous, plus wrong color names, duplicate listings of the exact same product, wrong items sent, cm measurements instead of inches, long driveling descriptions like ""You look pretty, sexy for you, so sensual, best dress make you feel luxurious, husband like you better, wear to party, office, vacation, pool, shopping, best dress for your wear...."" . Oh, it gets so freakin' old. For once I'd like to see a whole bunch of LITERATE listings for products.2. Searching for products on Amazon is an absolute joke: You cannot pick your own price-range (it has to be 25$+); when you do a manual search for a specific brand, the results still show off-brands and often will be loosely related to the search you entered; The Asian sellers have illiterate store names: ""Floerns"", Cufech"", ""Linkiom"", ""BTFBM"", ""Dokootoo"", ""Romwe"" ""Micticsi"", and they're everywhere on the site.3. I'm convinced Amazon purposefully rearranges customer product reviews, since the review dates are often out of date order (not sequential); There's absolutely no way 10's of thousands of products all have 5-star reviews before you would see any negative reviews for those thousands of products! At the top of a product review page you can see the percentage of 1-5 star reviews, yet I have had to go in as far as 18-20 pages of product reviews to find ANY ratings under 5 stars. Absolutely ridiculous.4. Amazon Prime isn't worth $140 a year (it went up from $120 in 2022): Prime Video is supposedly free, but most of the videos COST money to watch. I don't use digital books, so that's not a perk for me; I can still get products delivered within 3 days or so, sometimes earlier, and I can find things for a good, low price WITHOUT PRIME!

Their people are spoiled little know-it-alls who are arrogant and actually know very little. Many Amazon representatives have very heavy accents, are difficult to understand, in many cases speaking broken English, lacking basic writing skills. This translates into people who cannot understand what you are calling about or how to help you. Amazon yet again ticked me off with more aggravating issues.  First was a problem with my Amazon 55"" Omni TV which recently started having additional software issues, this time with the picture setting Vivid. I called Amazon and explained the TV would not stay on the Vivid setting and kept going to Natural instead. This was never an issue in the past. Per their request I rebooted the TV, after, I unplugged the TV which still did not work. They then wanted me to reset the TV back to factory settings which I said I would not do as it would not fix the issue, the problem was on their end and that they needed to submit a ticket. The Amazon support person said they cannot until I reset the TV as requested. After over an hour, I advised I would just wait until someone else calls, then takes the hours to reset the TV for them to find out I was right. It only took two days for me to be proven right and the issue to be fixed. Next I wrote a product review for a shampoo and conditioner as follows, which was rejected by morons several times.Review: Title: Excellent product - highly recommend.Text: I developed a very itchy scalp from environmental allergies which was greatly exacerbated by another high end conditioner. Even when I stopped using it, the itch would not go away, even after several months. I read many reviews, found this conditioner along with the shampoo which was in a two pack. Love it. Stopped the itch completely, and it keeps it under control. Both the Shampoo and Conditioner smell great. I did receive a card in the mail from the manufacturer stating I would receive a small gift for leaving a honest review which I would have done without it, so it was just an additional benefit. Tip: In my opinion the conditioner goes faster, so we buy at least a couple of the combination pack, and then an extra one or two of the conditioner.Amazons reply: Hello, Specifically, I would like to draw your attention to the following guideline: -We don't allow content that advocates or threatens physical or financial harm to yourself or others. ------ review you posted (as listed above) the line we rejected for is ""Stopped the itch completely, and it keeps it under control."" Why we rejected ---1. Product work differently for every individual not same working for everyone.2. If you said it worked perfectly and we approved and if some another customer uses it and have harsh reactions , then that person will be in serious trouble.Note, my review is like millions of others giving their opinion. Amazon has dug in their heels. Their CEO and Executives are cowards who cannot and will not take the time to respond to the little people, instead their underpaid, low intelligence employees handle it. From this point on, purchasing from Amazon is only, and I mean only in on an emergency basis, such as for health issues where I cannot get the product anywhere else. From what I read I believe they already laid off around 10,000 employees, and I look forward to many more to come.  Amazon is very slowly becoming a thing of the past. A relative has Walmart+ and they are making inroads, getting better and better by the day. I will make sure to post my opinion on every website possible along with sending copies of the Amazon email to family and friends for a good laugh!",2023,04,April,2023,8.0,1.0,low

Then they sealed it again to look unopened. After numerous attempts to talk to a person I finally gave up. I was instructed to return the item which I did. After Amazon received the box the sent an automated reply saying the parts were not returned and the contents would be discarded and no refund given. Hours more on the phone got nothing and nowhere. After this the only option was to file a credit card dispute for the amount. A nightmare and Amazon never got a manager to call me to discuss or even check into what I was saying to see who previously bought and returned the item. They don’t care. They don’t care even now losing me as a 10 year or more customer. I cancelled my Prime membership and all other Amazon service. They do not deserve or respect their customers. The worst experience buying something online. Amazon can not be trusted they will not look into or care at all when their own customer is scammed.

Anyone could be using your name and details to make fake purchases! if you have closed my account why is my personal information still remaining on your data and being used! this only happened because i called them out of what looked like fraudulent activity by sellers or whomever they are, I ordered and was sent items that would break or no longer work within a couple of weeks. when speaking to customers service they were asking for access to my computer!  when trying to get hold of the seller after purchasing an item, the shop would have been closed,  so you cannot contact them for refund or using a new name. as most sellers have two or three different shop names. I complained about this also complaint about the warranty which has been manipulated on most purchases example: upon purchasing an item when you read the description, i would always only purchase from amazon and fulfilled by amazon! and there would be a year or three year warranty, then upon returning to the site that would of been changed to one month or less than that! and a different seller name, not amazon! never purchase from third parties! or tried not too, when the item broke, I would then go back to the site only to find the listing that I bought, changed to some other shop which is now closed! so, you cannot contact anyone to get a refund! so the third party is changing the script to make it look like i am purchasing from amazon when in fact it is not! I called amazon out regarding this and they obviously are not happy! or the third parties that are mad because there scams have been exposed, then my email was harvested for a data breach , my mobile number was used in the usa and so on and so on, you cannot trust these people with your banking as someone from amazon went to collect monies from my bank account! and you cannot trust them with your personal data! their staff are untrustworthy! use with great caution! infact do not use try and find someone else to buy from! support your local businesses. I have now contacted amazon as to what they as a company is still using my personal data for, and what the information is they are holding of me to track my online presents.

The delivery driver faked the delivery as they didn't even show up, but noted that they attempted to deliver my package which is a lie as I was at the delivery point waiting for the package.The driver called once I picked up on the second ring and they hung up. I'm very disappointed in Amazon logistics and have requested for them to be removed as a delivery option for future orders because I don't trust their delivery drivers. I'll take my chances with Canada Post.Update- I was told yesterday that my package would be delivered this morning and still no package. When I call the other logistics team member who answered told me that the manager from yesterday misinformed me and that they can't deliver packages within a specific timeframe, I asked if that was the case then the site wouldn't give expected delivery times.This whole process has been stupid and stressful. I have been very inconvenienced and Amazon didn't try to help instead they are only giving me the run around all on a package that was supposed to be delivered yesterday.

5828,US,I recently ordered electric mountain bike,I recently ordered electric mountain bike from Amazon for $379. Two days later my wife decided she wanted the same one as well. So I looked up the same bike and the price was now advertised for a lesser price of $353. I immediately added it to my cart. I had not yet received my bike yet at this point. I got back to my house 2 hours later and went to purchase my wife her bike but when I went to purchase the bike in the cart the price jumped back up to $379 even though it still showed $353 in the cart. I then contacted customer service to see why this was happening. They were very rude from the start of our conversation. They continued to gaslight every question I was asking. They then requested I send them screenshots of what I was trying to explain…. So I did. I was then put on hold for 15 minutes. When she came back “CS” she stated that in that two hour period the price had changed and had gone up. Never explaining why it still said the lower price in my cart. I then went back to my cart after getting nowhere with customer service. I then saw that they had adjusted the price in my cart on the same bike to $455 after our conversation. This company is corrupt from the top down to the bottom. Great way to appreciate a member of your store. Sorry for the long story.

I gave my neighbor my package and assumed my package was on another truck. I then realize that my delivery status was updated to delivered with a picture of my neighbors package. I contacted Amazon about this and they stated they weren’t responsible after delivery. The only problem was my package was never delivered so they should be responsible. I was then berated by one of the “supervisors” and told I was lying and couldn’t speak to anyone else. I was then bombarded with different emails from different representatives saying they weren’t responsible or I would need to show a picture of the incorrect package (I let them know that it was given to the right address so I wouldn’t be able to take a picture). After 3 days the last email I received stated that too much time had gone by and there was nothing else they could do.

Only your money.Here is what you will get when sending a Amazon Seller a message:Please limit your text to less than 4000 characters. For your security, do not include any personal information including email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers or credit card numbers in your message.So here is my question ???If I can’t give the Seller any of my personal information….how am I supposed to get warranty coverage for an item purchased on Amazon ??(Don’t bother contacting Amazon after 30 days for help either. They will simply tell you that the return window has closed and that there is nothing else that they can do.)You have to play a game with Amazon and send messages to Seller’s in a way that Amazon won’t intercept the message and it is undeliverable.I usually type everything out on paper and take a picture of it and use that to send a message to the Seller via Amazon messaging.Lastly, if you leave a Seller a honest and fair review and Amazon doesn’t like your honesty…..you will get a nasty red message and they also DO NOT reply for a explanation either. If you are in the mood for a extremely hard time, difficulties & terrible, bad customer service after 30 days of purchase….contact Amazon via chat or a phone call.

And they follow up with please just return the item. And if I want to pay, they can set up UPS pick up.

After all this then they wanted to call me and I refused because I’m already an hour and a half late because of them.

5877,US,AMAZON LACK OF CUSTOMER CARE,"AMAZON, VERY POSSIBLY THE WORST BIG COMPANY ON THE PLANET WHEN IT COMES TO CUSTOMER CARE,,, IT SHOULD BE, ""CUSTOMER (WE DO NOT) CARE""!Now, I have no problem with saying that parts of the issues stem from my somewhat limited computer skills and my eventual loss of patience. The loss of patience however, was exacerbated by the Amazon System and the people I had eventually encountered.The System: I believe Amazon is one of the biggest companies on the planet and deals with such large volume of commerce giving them EXTREME POWER OVER SOCIETY AS A WHOLE,,, CONTROL OVER SELECT GROUPS,,, AND AS FAR AS THE INDIVIDUAL GOES... GREASE FOR THE GEARS! Amazon (and other huge companies highly advanced in technology) want to eliminate the ""Human Factor"" from their companies. They want ALL COMMUNICATIONS to be done with bots/A.I. on their end of the transactions... keep taking money from people to continue their automation and computerization. THEN, AS WAS WITH ME, the System failed. A $30 golf club arrives in bent box, broken in half. Needed to ask a question, (may have been somewhat or partially answered in their jumble of ""prepared answers"" if not in the first 50 or so maybe in the second group of 50 or so or 3rd group,,,). I struggled a bit but found a link to live chat. WHERE IT SEEMS MOST SITES YOU GO TO, YOU GET BOMBARDED WITH POP UP ADS,,, AND MOST JUMP RIGHT OUT WITH A, ""LET'S CHAT NOW, WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH TODAY"", I had to search around and when I got to the page, I started with a question, it said somethinglike,  ""chat has been started , you are #1 in queue"". About 20 minutes later, I did what they wanted, I ENDED THE CHAT, WITHOUT EVER GETTING ANY REPLY. So next is the attempt to call. Forget it. Not after West Coast work hours, unless you do not mind talking with some whoever, from wherever on the other side of the planet. I mind. Conversation with foreign dialect/accents is tough enough then add the stress brought about by personal and financial information in a world loaded with scammers and con artists. After running into a couple of walls with offshore AND NONE OF THEM ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING YOU ANY HELP WITH CONTACTING A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE COMPANY. EVEN GETTING TO SPEAK WITH A SUPERVISOR IS A BATTLE WITH SOME.SO,,, I call the U.S. Corporate phone #. WORTHLESS! IF AMAZON IS LOOKING WHERE TO SAVE SOME WASTED MONEY,,, ELIMINATE THE ""CUSTOMER SUPPORT CALL CENTER"", ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS. HEARTLESS. SOULLESS, UNCOMPASSIONATE GROUP THAT DO VERY LITTLE TOWARD HELPING (ME ANYWAY),,, AND THEY LIE! CHECK Y'ALLS RECORDINGS! The U.S. CUSTOMER SUPPORT PHONE #, basically 5 prompts. 1- customer service- gives recorded instructions to GO ONLINE. 2- instructions. 3- instructions. 4- instructions. Prompt #5- THE LIVE PEOPLE THAT DIRECT YOU TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE,,, THEY ARE JUST THE CALL CENTER,,, CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE NUMBER I CALLED THAT EVENTUALLY RETURNS TO THEM!WHEN YOU START GETTING LOUD BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT LISTENING WHEN YOU TELL THEM THAT DOING WHAT THEY TOLD ME TO DO DIDN'T WORK AND ASK ""NOW WHAT?"",,, THEY THEN HANG UP ON YOU. AFTER TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT THEY EITHER AREN'T LISTENING OR DON'T UNDERSTAND, THEY HANG UP ON YOU. BETWEEN THE SYSTEM ITSELF AND THE LIVE AGENTS IN THE CALL CENTER IN SEATTLE WASHINGTON, I CONTINUED TO CALL JUST TO GET A SCRIPT READ TO ME SAYING THEY HAVE GIVEN ME ALL THE HELP AND GUIDEANCE AVAILABLE AT THEIR LEVEL AND THEN HANG UP ON ME... WOULD NOT TELL ME WHAT TO DO WHEN WHAT THEY HAVE TOLD ME TO DO DOESN'T WORK.It concludes with a final attempt at 1 of many AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE #s.

First off, I’ve never had so many issues with shipping until recently. They now use USPS for shipping and they are the worst! They literally lie about attempting to deliver and get away with it with no solutions offered after the fact. I’ve had this happen 3 times now and I work from home. They’ll say an item is being delivered then all of a sudden the status changes to attempted delivery when no one ever came to my door. Never used to happen when they solely used their own drivers. Getting in contact with them is also a nightmare trying to get it reshipped. If that’s not bad, reaching out to the customer service line is a complete joke now and operations seem sketchy. We used Amazon for our baby registry recently and received some gift cards we put on our account to be used later. Fast forward to the next day I get an email about 100 dollars of the gift cards being used for a PlayStation gift card. A) we don’t have any gaming systems. B) I didn’t even receive an email to approve or deny an unknown login like I always do when I sign in. I called customer service twice about this and get the same answer that someone will call me back in 2 days and no one ever does. The only thing I get is a bogus email stating they believe someone accessed my account and they have taken steps to ensure my account is safe and that the gift card funds will be reimbursed in 2-3 days. It’s been over a week now and no call back and the gift card isn’t reimbursed. Wouldn’t be surprised if this was some shady internal thing going on at the rate this company is going. We just want our money back. It used to be so easy calling in and getting a resolution in one phone call, now it just a joke and complete waste of time and no one actually cares about your issues.",2023,03,March,2023,1.0,1.0,low

5999,US,"Does not reliably deliver on delivery promises, questionable products from big name brands","This review is based upon a continued worsening of service from Amazon. We have been doing business with Amazon since late 2016, and had mostly satisfactory service from them until the pandemic happened. Our biggest problem is a failure to deliver products on time, if at all. For example. I was just informed for the 4th time in a single week that an order was going to be late, or as with the one I was just informed of, completely undeliverable. This used to happen on occasion, but now happens regularly. Dealing with customer service is just some customer service rep repeating a sentence, phrase or paragraph from the ""how to get rid of (choose your own descriptor) customer as quickly as possible with as little help/work as possible"" book they must all be handed the second they are hired. The second problem we regularly deal with, from day one, is receiving faulty, fake, knock-off, etc. products from ""big brand"" names, such as Energizer (entire 12-pack of CR2450 batteries that were bad), Wrangler (jeans that look like factory rejects, buttons sewed in wrong spot, horrible dye jobs), so on and so forth. That problem was easily solved, only order the cheap knock-off items from Amazon, that way you know what to expect. We order the name brand stuff from Walmart, and those orders rarely arrive late and/or in bad condition.We have tried to be understanding of the problems going on in the world, but we pay for the prime membership mainly for the free two-day shipping promises, and Amazon just cannot deliver on that any longer. Also, if they are able to pull my money immeditately upon ""placing order"", then I shouldn't have to wait 5 business days for a return of my $71 for an order that became ""undeliverable"" on the day it was supposed to be delivered. We cancelled the membership today, and decided to leave a review here, not necessarily to try to hurt Amazon, but to make future customers aware of problems they will likely run into.",2023,03,March,2023,6.0,1.0,low

The last four times my bank has called me about fraudulent charges or some clown from India or Pakistan called saying I made a purchase on my Prime Account, which I don't have for $1900. or some like amount.  First, how did they get my phone number, secondly they have my name and address because I didn't give it to them.  The thing that pisses me off is each time they do this the bank kills my debit card and issues a new 1 which can take up to 10 days unless you opt to pay $25 for express delivery cause the nearest branch is 200 miles away.  When I called Customer Service to ask about the possibility of a data breach the nutjob had no IDEA of what I was talking about.  So I asked if there was a security person or someone with a little more knowledge he said there was no one around so I asked for a supervisor but he couldn't find one of them either. If this happened just once, no big deal. But 4 times and for them to act as if it isn't anything, give me a break!  I can't be the only one!

The nutjob I spoked to at Amazon was Ben, totally useless.  How do they get the info if someone is not feeding it to them?  I guess Amazon doesn't want people to know their info is at risk?

6117,CA,Why Amazon is going to be worst?,"amazon is a very fast company. it’s delivery quality is very low because of its hard and fast work of delivery to increase the number of packages that the drivers are delivering every day by subcontractors. AMAZON is gifting subcontractor companies that have more speed. AMAZON is not paying any money for the quality of the delivery to the subcontractors and delivery drivers. Amazon’s subcontractors tries to increase 60 stops to 190 stops in 1 month after employing a delivery driver. they try to deliver 270 packages in 190 stops in just 9 hours in the city by 1 delivery driver! By adding packages, Amazon’s subcontractors makes the drivers move at an extraordinary speed, which is very dangerous and illegal. If the driver runs on all the stairs and their knee does not take the ignition, it will be unbelievable. Now do customers expect such a company to deliver packages to them in the better condition? how can the driver deliver every package to the costumer’s hand with out delay? The driver is controlled by a very powerful Amazon application, and subcontractor’s company managers are always calling and talking about increasing the speed. they are distinguishing all the delivery driver’s location. they are calling them permanently. if a driver call a costumer and loose the time and return a package. the driver will loose the job in a very tricky way. Therefore, the best service that Amaron currently offers by these subcontractor delivery companies. that's it.  If you feel that Amazon’s subcontractor bosses are not greedy and the problem is with the delivery drivers. Work for Amaron for just 1 month to understand how this company works and with what speed and workload of workers on the border of physical injury?  According to the company's wide and long contract, the workers cannot even complain about this economic promise in court.  According to the agreement, they must refer to the private dispute resolution council and they do not have the right to complain in court in case of damage or accident because of running on the ice. All packages are registered with photos in the Amazon system.  Therefore, if your package is delivered to your door and a passer-by steals it, or the package is lost, or it gets wet and damaged due to wind and rain, you should contact the amazon , in some cases, amazon is refunding but it depends on the situation. in conclusion, amazon is caring about the costumers rather than their employees. so, they are loosing their employees every day because of hard pressure on them.",2023,03,March,2023,1.0,1.0,low

When I checked the tracking its showing March 7th, 2023. I contacted customer service (Shalu and Steven via chat) I was told that the item was not in stock (when placing order it showed 7 in stock) so they would have to backdate the order and get it from a different fulfillment center. Well, if this was known to me when placing the order, I would have not placed this order itself as the vendor could get it delivered much faster. All the time the agent-Steven kept saying the actual estimated delivery time is displayed on the checkout page and also when you get a confirmation email that order is placed. I had canceled the initial order and I am very sure of no such longer delivery date was suggested. However, I still placed a dummy order (#702-0941180-8361033) to check their claims, now I have screenshots which clearly suggests guaranteed delivery by March 3rd on checkout page and also the confirmation email they sent me. When contacted customer service, they offered me $5 as account credits. I am not interested in credits or extra money.

Even if he was just there a couple of days earlier, he repeats the scamming and begging, all over again.  He claims to be a supervisor, but I think it’s just more of his lies.  How low of a person do you have to be, to think it’s okay to scam federal employees, or anyone, for that matter?!  Since Amazon does not care about anyone who comes into contact with their workers, it is not very surprising that this type of bad behavior is allowed.  Their customer service needs major help, as well.  Recently, I phoned and was connected to Singapore.  Amazon workers hung up on me, lied to me, told me to call back, etc.  Due to all of these issues, I ended up having to speak with four different employees, that day.  Five days later, the bank notified me of a fraudulent charge of $700, made in Singapore.  Clearly, Amazon keeps allowing their employees to treat customers with zero respect.

And in all that time, I've witnessed and experienced a progressive erosion in the quality of service provided by, and an increased lack of professionaIism, diligence, understanding, and/or intelligence on the part of Amazon's Customer Service staff.  Today was the worst, most nightmarish experience yet.  I had to return a malfunctioning Fire TV.  Everything went smoothly until I received the replacement TV today.  It arrived without a remote, power cord, or legs. Now whether or not I was supposed to KEEP those parts from the TV I returned, I have no idea.  None of the reps I dealt with at the time said anything of the sort.   So I spent over 3 hours on the phone or chat with Amazon trying to figure out the easiest way to get a TV that was complete and works.  I was transferred to various individuals (11 at last count -- and I was disconnected or cut off from THREE of those) all saying they would fix the problem to my satisfaction.  However, nothing ever ever happened and the only solution that they could ultimately come up with is for me to return THIS TV as well, and they'd issue a refund (when they're good and ready). Some of the suggestions provided by some of the agents were frankly ludicrous.  One actually suggested that I go online (on Amazon, of course) and order the missing parts, purchase them, and then request a REFUND for those items FROM Amazon! When I asked if she could provide me those item numbers (since she was supposedly affiliated with their ""special"" Fire TV unit), or better yet JUST SEND ME those missing parts, she simply ignored my request.  Especially when I asked why she thought it would be acceptable for me to PAY again for something that should have been included WITH the TV to begin.Anyway, towards the end of all of this, having hit the end of my patience, the reps wouldn't even listen to me, went into some spiel about how they are entitled to terminate their calls, which several of them did.  The follow-up emails I received were just as abrupt and helpless/hopeless.  So I'm sitting here with a TV that is no use to me; waiting for UPS to pick it up to return it.  And then -- once Amazon in Lexington KY gets it -- I'll have to wait a good month or longer to see a penny of what I've paid.  Frankly, I'm not holding my breath.  I've read the postings here from people who PURPORTEDLY work for Amazon's Customer Support.  One says that most of their reps are located here in the US.  Color me suspicious, but I highly doubt it.  One also says they DO have a bit of autonomy and flexibility regarding what they can and cannot do for a customer.  Again, color me doubtful:  all I was told over and over again today (from 95% of those I spoke to or dealt with) is essentially their hands are tied, and they are limited to what they can or cannot do based on their systems and its policies.",2023,02,February,2023,3.0,1.0,low

6379,GB,Delivery attempted - we ran into an issue when attempting your delivery (the new lie),"After several years of primarily good experiences with Amazon (and them being my first port of call for all online orders) something has recently changed. In the last couple of months, Amazon drivers appear to be allowed to get away with the same lies that cowboy courier services indulge in, which is claiming that a delivery has been attempted when they have not bothered to knock, or follow simple instructions on the delivery notes. This has now happened with my last two orders in a row. High value items? Forget it. The new 'one time passcode' protocol is nothing but hassle every single time - if you live in an apartment, or flat, these are the orders that the drivers are most likely to lie about attempting to deliver and will simply walk away without trying (all for the cause of avoiding actually having to come to your door, or even calling you on the phone to come down and collect). If they can't dump it in reception they'll simply leave the premise without trying and lie on the tracking. Whether it's drivers lying, or system problems with Amazon that mean the driver is unable to accept your code, it's an absolute headache every time. I'm still waiting for my recent order - the driver lied about attempting to deliver yesterday. I called Amazon who scheduled a redelivery for the next day. However, last night my parcel was put out again for evening delivery (unbeknown to their system or tracker) - the driver actually came to my door this time. However, due to an Amazon customer service rep organising the redelivery for the next day, the 'one time passcode' was no longer active and the driver was not able to hand me my parcel. What a joke - the parcel was right there but they refused to hand it over due to system errors and outright confusion. The standard of driver behaviour and quality of service has clearly taken a massive nosedive.

The CS assistant was very helpful and cancelled future US subscriptions. I asked if she could go back on my account and see if other automatic payments I may have missed had gone through. She could not and referred me to raise it with my bank. I asked if I could see my payment history on Amazon.com page and told yes.   Looking at my history it doesn’t show any annual subscriptions.  So, either subs were not previously taken or subs were and I’m unable to see them.   If no subs previously taken by Amazon.com why the email to update my payment details?  I asked for an email to escalate my query to to be told not possible. How can a company as huge as Amazon have no way to escalate concerns/complaints?  This is not great customer service.

Which was total lies by the driver.!!Amazon calling card stuck in between the 2 letter box flaps found the next morning. On the card there was no reference, no name, no item or order number, no driver details, no date,no time.. all it said was 'bin'. I went out side looked around bins and in bins and found no parcels !! Called Amazon customer services 30 + times now and 15 + emails for a refund of the items i paid for and not recieved, was told to report to my local police and get a crime reference number which i did, police were very helpful. Amazon say they tried calling the police but are put on hold and cannot contact police to verify the crime of supposedly stolen items( or failed delivery ) Amazon have told me to call the police to verify the crime reference, but the police won't reveal it to me over the phone as data protection and i am the victim, so god knows how amazon think how they will get my data !! So basically going round in circles day after day calling and emailing them like am at a circus talking to clowns at customer service.

I have been an excellent customer of Amazon's forgoing true stores for ease of access.  Never ever again.  The frustrations, lies ect are so not worth it if you have an issue.  This gentlemen stated that no refund would be issued as I only had 30 days to return and I would have to deal with their supplier.  Understand, that these items were purchased in good faith through Amazon.  I do not know their suppliers nor did I sign up to deal with them at this level.  Amazon needs to stand behind anything they promote and obviously this is not the case. So very sad and wrong Amazon.  Never ever again.",2023,02,January,2023,3.0,1.0,low

Amazon finally arranged a DPD collection but set the delivery address back to my own address! How stupid can you be. Its now been over 3 weeks and customer service are now refusing to talk to my regarding this return hanging the phone up and ending chats immediately still no refund in sight after sending the item back and tracking confirming its been collected. £300 out of pocket and countless hours wasted on trying to commune with Amazon's customer service representatives which all seem to share one useless braincell.,2023,02,January,2023,1.0,1.0,low

This light was picked and shipped by Amazon.  The light I received was used, boxed sealed with packing tape, no bubble wrap, no glass strip protector and dirty. I called Amazon and they told me I can return it but I get nothing because it’s promotional.  I told them it was picked and shipped from Amazon warehouse.  They won’t take responsibility that they sent me a used item.   They told me in the system it is marked as new.  I simply asked to send this back and they can send me a new one like they were supposed to do in the first place. They blamed it on a third party seller.  It’s also an argument with them when I have to return an item.  They use to use canada post, but now they use purolator, knowing that purolator isn’t as available in some cities, like myself it is a 30 min drive.  I told them this over and over but they don’t care.  The customer service people, wow, horrible mostly from Philippines and Indian, are rude and they can’t answer your question they get frustrated and the last thing I get, I can’t help so I am ending the call, they just hang up and then send a survey, unreal!!!All I asked Amazon to do is to send me a new light as per the company who makes them and the promotion code and I will send the used one back.

This was clearly not true as I am still able to request a return label.

She clearly wanted to argue and sound forceful and controlling rather than supportive.This type of customer service is unacceptable and I demand that Amazon take appropriate action to address this issue. I expect a full refund for the product and a sincere apology for the experience I had to endure.I also expect Amazon to take appropriate corrective action to ensure this type of customer service is not repeated.

On the times where u are in and they do knock, they run off leaving it outside, before you can receive the parcel and whether you are in or out it's just left, when u are out they send you an email to say it was handed to resident when it wasn't. The customer service is abysmal! It's impossible to get anyone on the phone and it took me over an hour and a half to get anyone one on the chat bots.

So far so good, were it not that Amazon (.com where my initial account is registered and all e-book purchases) removed the book in the library of my device (the one I already owned). As a frequent customer of Amazon's very 1st hour I loved shopping there (mainly books, paper versions & e-books). Its Customer Service used to be excellent. It was approachable by email, people working there understood what the problem was. Now it turned into a sheer nightmare. There is a chat option which is a complete waste of time. Spent exactly 2 hours reading hollow niceties such as “I really apologize for the inconvenience” and “I understand your concern regard the e book” and repeated ad nauseum, but the person was unable to offer a solution because he/she just didn’t understand what the issue was. After exactly 2 hours I stopped the chat because I had to attend a meeting.  A company that sells products under its own responsibility should have a well-functioning customer service. Refunds are not always the only solution. In my case I want to know where the (paid for) ebook is I bought a couple of years ago.

Right at the top of the results was an ad for Amazon with the item listed at the price I wanted, but when I clicked on it the price on their site was still the higher price. When I contacted their customer service again to point this out, there response was that they don't honor any price advertised anywhere else besides our site.

Number 3: prime music was fantastic but they have destroyed the prime music experience as you can now no longer listen to your favourite playlist music even though asking Alexa who now recommends and plays completely different music. Seriously Amazon you need to return this app to its original way to get your loved customers back even if you need to increase the price from £75 to £85 a year. Number 4: time and time again I’m greeted by what looks to be overworked staff drivers who sometimes just leave your package on the door or are to lazy to even ring the doorbell and will just shove it through the letterbox. Lastly your company has become the Mr Krabs within the delivery world. To get customers to stay with you. You need to learn and listen to your customers on what they loved about you and what they hated. Find ways of getting more money for example you could add a reward system so every 5th purchase on an item could get a customer a free extra benefit this will make customers want to buy more items which in turn will get you more customers.

After realizing I needed a cable to connect to a conference at 10am the next morning, I purchased this item specifically because it had next morning delivery, even adding two other items I did not need to be above the $25 threshold for the 4am-8am delivery. I woke up at 6 because I didn't want the package sitting out front after sunrise only to find the item hadn't shipped yet. After waiting until 9am, only because the order had changed to 'preparing to ship' before I raced to Walmart and purchased the item. Later, the order delivery time changed to between 5pm & 10pm, so I used the Amazon assistant to cancel the order, but received a message saying that it might be too late to cancel. Shortly after I got an email saying it was too late to cancel. I then used the messaging system and after initially being told the same thing by 2 employees, I was put in touch with a supervisor who told me he contacted the warehouse to cancel order. A short time later I saw that the item now showed 'shipped' but still had delivery window of 5p to 10pm. This time I requested a call back, and after wasting approximately 45 minutes trying to explain that because it had not arrived in the promised timeframe, I was forced to purchase it already and since I had only purchased it because of early morning delivery, even adding items I did not need to be eligible, asking for order to be cancelled was not an unreasonable request. The two employees and 'supervisor' I spoke with were not helpful and even rude, telling me the item had shipped (but wouldn't arrive for another 5-9 hours), they could not cancel order. I know for a fact that they can contact drivers because of a previous missed delivery where they contacted driver to complete delivery the same night. But all attempts to cancel this order were denied, telling me I would either have to track the order and be out front when truck arrived to refuse delivery or waste my time to return item. The order was delivered at 7pm, I tried tracking, checking about every 5 minutes, but somehow after seeing 6 deliveries before mine, when I next checked back it showed delivered. I was not asking for anything outrageous, they failed to meet the promised delivery window, which is THE ONLY REASON I MADE PURCHASE, even adding two items for my dog in order to get order above $25, this shouldn't have been an issue.

6588,US,Amazon Delivery doesn't really know how to deliver anything,"I have been a loyal amazon prime customer for years. I ordered an XTERRA 4500 Treadmill on January 9th, 2023 and paid the additional $99 for assembly and room of choice delivery. On January 13th, a third party delivery service ""JB Hunt"" Arrived at my door, and the delivery drivers informed me that the treadmill was too heavy to take upstairs, and offered to leave it in the garage. I informed them that I had paid for the room of choice service, and they said to contact Amazon to establish different delivery options. I called Amazon that day, spending more than 3 hours on the phone being transferred between multiple departments from account services, to heavy and bulky, to home services. During that phone call, the customer service representative in Heavy and Bulky assured me that Jb Hunt had no right to refuse delivery because I had paid for room of choice, and the treadmill only weighed 213 lbs. He assured me that if I reschedule the delivery, they will redeliver it, and that he could not change the delivery company. Consequently, I rescheduled the delivery for Wednesday, January 18th. On that day,  The same Jb Hunt driver arrived and informed me that they could not take the treadmill up the stairs. I contacted Amazon for a second time and Amazon apologized profusely and provided me a 20% discount for my inconvenience issued as a gift card, And reassured me again that Jb Hunt should have delivered the package, and rescheduled a 3rd re delivery attempt for the following day. On January 19th, Jb Hunt did not even bother to show up. Instead, the order was cancelled, unilaterally and marked fraudulently by Jb Hunt and marked as undeliverable for lack of access to the front door, which is NOT true. I called Amazon, and they informed me that I could fill out a special form with their heavy and bulky department that would specify that I do not wish Jb Hunt to deliver products to me anymore, and to re-order the treadmill. After filling out that form, and attempting to re-order the treadmill, I found that Amazon refused to give me the 20% discount on the 2nd order for my inconvenience. Honestly, after 9 hours of waiting through their delivery windows, and spending more than 6 hours on the phone with Amazon customer service to figure out how this Treadmill should get this delivered, I found it shocking that Amazon refused to carry the 20% discount to my 2nd attempt at purchasing the treadmill, even though I would have been able to get that 20% if Jb Hunt would have delivered the package like they were supposed to. In summary, Amazon delivery and logistics is a mess. The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, and their third party delivery contractors such as Jb Hunt refused to do what they are contractually obligated to do and the customer is caught in the middle. Amazon kept insisting that Jb Hunt must deliver, and Jb Hunt refused to deliver and I wasted more than 15 hours of my life trying to coordinate between the two. I cancelled my prime membership because honestly, prime delivery is more like crappy delivery.",2023,01,January,2023,1.0,1.0,low

However I contacted Amazon about the first watch refunded without the custom charges being repaid. This was quickly sorted and a refund issued. After enquiring about the next watch, I've now been told that the remaining custom charges of approximately £160 wil take up to 180 days for each customs charge to be refunded...

6625,US,Turnaround,"When Amazon was experiencing rapid growth, the company's management focused on growing market share and managing company growth. This is why Amazon is notorious for selling counterfeit products. But, with the global economy contracting and Amazon's sales with it, the company's management has shifted its focus to prioritize its customers. For example, Amazon has implemented many reforms designed to eliminate counterfeit products from its website. In addition, customer reviews on the Amazon site for food products provide many examples of the company selling outdated and stale products. Amazon is also addressing this issue, with a new focus on delivering food products in an acceptable condition. In fact, I order canned foods by the case from Amazon because they arrive in pristine condition. In stark contrast, their largest competitor refuses to sell canned foods by the case and instead ships severely damaged cans to its customers.

6651,BE,A true story about Stephane and Menzzo,"A true story about Stephane and Menzzo, a company  supported by Amazon. Ripping of people can have heartbreaking consequencesSummer 2020, after 15 years of marriage, my friend Stephane and his wife are separating. Life stops for Stéphane for a moment, he rents a small apartment in Brussels, except for a chair and a table, there is nothing there, the once so lively creative man was onlya shadow of himself. He misses his two daughters very much during the week. After a hopeless year, of intense sadness, in 2021, Stéphane decides to put his life back on track, he works very hard, as a freelance cameraman, also for our company, and takes care of his 2 children with great pleasure and dedication during the weekend. He saves as much money as possible, lives like a hermit and is convinced to lead a respectable life again in no time. After a few months of saving, Stéphane decides to place an order at a French low budget, online furniture store, to finally furnish his apartment, fully motivated he really wanted to make a new start. Unfortunately something goes wrong with the delivery. (what we don't know and is also irrelevant) The goods go back to the supplier and Stéphane waits months to see his money back. Unfortunately after dozens of apologies, the money is not coming back. He no longer has any savings and at his small apartment in Brussels, the social inspector comes by one day after a complaint from his ex-wife, where according to her the children did not have the necessary accommodation to stay with daddy. After this visit we never heard from our friend again, he used his only furniture, his table and chair to do the most unthinkable and took his own life. Months after his death we found printed advertising in his drawer, from a few furniture companies, also Menzzo, we read some reviews and together with the editors decided to place an order at both companies, we ordered a table at one company, with a value of 700 €, this was returned and within a week we had all our money back. On the same day, we ordered 12 chairs from Menzzo, for a value of € 1250, until the end of last week, we did everything we could to get our money back , hoping that our suspicion would not be correct, but unfortunately we also keep getting to hear another excuse and another and another ....so we realize our money will never be paid back again. Our intention is certainly not to shame a company, we ourselves realize how difficult doing business is and that comments are always relative. That is why we decided to do the test ourselves, despite the many negative reviews already suggesting that the same pattern could be observed here as told by our good friend at the time. It is therefore only a suspicion that our friend ordered from them, yet they use the same method to rob people in this way and we found the printed adds remember. The customers who order furniture from Menzzo and other rogue companies are usually guided (misled) by cheap prices and are therefore happy that they can also afford a new table, chair or sofa, often they have to make a huge financial shortfall for this and use their last pennies to realize a small dream to have a dignified life again. Often it turns out that this trust is only a one-way street, deceit, abuse of trust and the umpteenth blow, which can lead to even the most ultimate act for people like Stéphane. Fortunately, there are still many companies that mean well. We can only hope that with the introduction of our website, good people like Stéphane will be warned about companies such as Menzzo. and their collaborators, because one day on Judgment Day, whatever your faith is, you will be welcomed by someone like Stéphane, or maybe by your own grandmother, grandfather, mother, father.... deeply disappointed in the choices you've made, ripping of other people, by the sad disillusioned look in their eyes, you can see, you did the wrong thing, no matter how hard you are trying to ignore it , carma can never be avoided. Not here, not now, not later.Please make sure that kind people like Stéphane, can't be the victim anymore of lawless CEO's like D.M. and all of his co-workers. Everyone of them is guilty, because they just have other choices. Don't buy from them, they are not worth it, inform Amazon of their practices, Facebook and other social media, the only way you can hurt them, is to hurt them in their wallet, because a heart they don't have.",2023,01,January,2023,36.0,1.0,low

6667,US,Amazon has lost ALL customer respect.,"I usually swear by Amazon, they were a company who could do no wrong as far as I was concerned.  But, their standards have fallen so far, I cannot support them anymore.  The final straw was just this last week when I bought a pair of JBL Gumy earbuds.  I bought them “Used: Like New” and was really excited when they arrived.  Then I opened them.  The earbuds were covered in earwax and it was disgusting!!  I didn’t bother doing a damn thing else, I boxed them back up and started the return.  Usually the returns are ridiculously easy, you take a QR code to any UPS Store and just drop off the return, the UPS Store does everything else.  This time, I’ve got to print out the label and box everything up all nicely myself.  Then, what really ticked me off, is they refused to post my review warning everyone else about these diseased earbuds.  I wrote a review (just like what I’m doing here) detailing exactly what happened and posting photos of the nasty earbuds.  I get an email saying they “could not post the review” mainly because it had “seller feedback.”  Since they’re the seller, I feel they’re just trying to cover their own asses by hiding things from unsuspecting buyers.  I’ll say the same thing here that I said in that review: NEVER waste your money buying used on these types of products.  Clearly, Amazon has ZERO return quality control protocols and they will resell any disgusting, worthless product as long as it gets them a few bucks.

6678,US,What happened to quality customer service?,"I ordered several items on Jan 2, this review in reference to the return I started on Jan 4 to exchange a couple of those items (a lunch bag and purse).  First, let me say AMAZON IS NOT what it used to be.  I tried to contact customer service and the ""request a call"" is NOT readily available.  I have to type call AMAZON in the search field.  I followed their instructions on the app and the computer and ""request a call"" does not pop up like they say it should.  But the real issue is this - upon requesting the return of these two items that came shipped together in the same box, yet evidently AMAZON uses two different return codes.  You can't know this because the code is non-discernable.  I dropped the items off to UPS and only scanned one item.  That is the only item showing up as refunded on my account.  Now we talking UPS not USPS, but evidently AMAZON STILL hasn't received the return so the refund is not processed on the second item and it's still showing ""refund started"".  (Oh and lets not forget the 30 day return policy, but your shipping sucks)Clearly AMAZON has outgrown its capabilities.  This is now the third issue I've had with them in recent months.  So to recap:a) calling customer service is not as easy as it used to beb) a simple note when returning multiple items that they will each receive different codes and each item needs to be scanned at drop off seems easy enoughc) shipping is a joke. Its slow in both directions, so why am I paying to be a PRIME MEMBERd) who doesn't offer exchanges (same item diff color/sz) without the whole return and reorder?  Thats just dumb!That CHAT is a joke!  That is automated as well.There is a such thing as TOO BIG! I've said it before and I will say it again AMAZON is slippin.  They are losing their touch.  They have hands in so many pies, they are losing sight of the little details that will cost them customers in the long run.I have already in the last year slowed my ordering from them.

Some supplied directly by Amazon, some by suppliers. But just as Amazon as a company.Your delivery drivers always come on the day they say they will. I appreciate that alot. I also appreciate the fact that when one of your drivers cannot find my house that they contact me and make sure they do. Sometimes your drivers leave a parcel on my doorstep when I'm not in and there are lots of hiding places here. So it would be better if they hid it and sent a picture like DPD. Sometimes they do move them out of view. But compared to Evri - you are winning. Your drivers deliver and I appreciate that now. In fact I'd say I took delivery drivers delivering for granted. Not anymore.Also- the couple of times I have had big problems, your employees have sorted it.1. Being charged tax on an expensive item that did not advertise there would be tax on the listing coming from abroad (they said all tax was included). You fixed it and the bill was sorted.2. My child spent over £1000 on game tokens when he got hold of my device and your refunded me. It took a while and a couple of attempts to sort out, but you did it.3. I had signed up accidentally to a prime feature without realising. You saw I hadn't used it and refunded me in whole.

6733,GB,Best online direct store,"I love Amazon. Customer support is ace and top notch, packaging and delivery or collection options set this company apart. I just wish more lockers available as sometimes collection is not an option for some products, Amazon has a buyer protection which is amazing and one of the best returns processes sometimes free, I would check as some market place platforms have free collections by Royal Mail from home. I honestly do not know what all the complaints are about because Amazon is the best thing and ebay since sliced bread for me. When you can not source stuff locally or even find better stuff cheaper online with logistics to die for lives me baffled how people are not able to engage with something so simple. Never been ripped off from Amazon, it is basically like a world wide market place, with buyer seller protection and some of the nest logistics option often for free with things like Amazon prime if you shop regularly. Thise reviews must be from people who do not know how to use a computer or a market place. I recall ordering from Amazon some Bruce Lee books when Amazon was the best place or a place to get books if you do not want to troll the internet or shop for locally with the convenience of best delivery options money can buy; I especially love the lockers and collection point options. Please please keep Amazon free of scammers and dodge people because that is what the internet is turning into with the online market place and electronic scammer scum bags out there and a den of bell ends. Literally if you have a product and would like to want to reach more markets or as it were all the markets Amazon is the place to sell as you can get stuff on here you simply could not else where from across the world with dirt cheap delivery always properly packed! I often feel like an inventor when searching for stuff as my mind will think of something I might need that will not probably be in the shops 60% of the time and you will 90% find what weird and wonderful wacky things you need on there whatever it is like everything for bicycles Amazon has it all, apart from maybe fast food delivery platforms haha they will probably end up doing that soon.

6745,US,Zero respect for the customer,"There's two parts to my review. I've had my book on Amazon since 2011. To cut the story short I updated the cover some 3 weeks ago now. The front cover was done overnight.I was told by Amazon that the second photo when you view my book on amazon.com, being that of the back cover will be updated in 10 business days. Ten business days were up on Friday 12-23-22. Excluding the two holidays that followed, I called back some 15 actual business days later and was told someone would call back within two business days.Not only was the cover never updated in the time frame and still hasn't been, no one has ever called me back.My second point to this review is their customer service. The last item that I had delivered the idiot driver left my package at the wrong house and not realizing this at the time I even stopped the driver as he left our premises and he said, ""Oh another driver will be by later, probably with your package."" When I realized an email had come through, the photograph showed that my package was exactly where he had delivered it on the premises a few doors away from my own.I've also noticed when you clearly explain something to one of these foreign agents over the phone when they reply it's as if they've not even listened to a word that you've said.UPDATE:Thursday 1-12-23. A lady called Shakero (sp) called me back today from the KDP department at Amazon per my request. I explained to her that we are now on 22 business days when I was told the back book cover would be updated within '10 business days.' I also explained to her that when I spoke to Andre on Tuesday 1-3-23 he said that someone would call me back from the KDP department within '48 hours.' I said to her that was 216 hours ago and no one has ever called me back. When I was done explaining everything the call was still connected and I constantly said 'hello' and no one ever spoke back.When I try to request a call again from Amazon this is what you get and this is how ridiculous this company is:'''You have already submitted a phone or chat contact request within the last few minutes.

Fast forward to today, the day before I needed to receive it. The item never shipped. When I called, they again, gave me the run around and told me that the reason it didn't ship was because the item was shipping from a third party company that was shipping the item from China. Which basically meant I was screwed out of my order..  when I asked to speak to a supervisor, she then gave me the run around again and told me that the item was out of stock and they couldn't issue a credit to the order until after January 7th, which was after the day of should've shipped.

I have read their rules for making product reviews and been very careful about following them. I have even resubmitted previously cancelled reviews with all the information removed except the most basic - i.e. This is a counterfeit item, etc.. And they cancelled them anyway. It seems to me that if you submit a negative review and attempt to post facts that any future reader could verify their self, then the review is cancelled. As long as your review looks like you are just a customer suffering buyer's remorse - it's fine and can be posted. Anything else and not so much. Attached are photos of a recent purchase that was a counterfeit item. The comment I attempted to leave at Amazon warning others was cancelled.

I ordered goods from them to arrive at an Amazon pick up hub, they send me a code to open the hub locker but it won't open. I spent 3 days trying to open it. What was worse I couldn't contact an Amazon services customer advisor because there isn't one, just a computer offering basic general questions that couldn't answer what I wanted answering. If I had a telephone number or an email then that would of helped my frustration but instead I'm left there standing frustrated that I had no idea why I couldn't access the hub and my parcels. But hey let's talk about global warming shall we! Now a van has to pick up my parcel send it back to the depot, then as I THINK about reordering my parcel another van has to pollute the air twice to get it to me; so much for Amazon's environmental policy well that is just a joke. Come on Amazon get a grip with customer services, stop making US the customers do all your dirty work and stop adding vehicle fumes to the environment unnecessarily transporting parcels back and forth when a customer services team can help reduce that problem.

Amazon France has reviews of the wrong film in French.  Amazon Italia has reviews of the wrong film in Italian.  Yet another update.  Amazon apologised and undertook to investigate.  It did not last. The next time I tried to log on Amazon decided they needed to be sure it was me, and sent a one-time code to my email address. That wasn't enough.  They supposedly sent another code to my mobile with a number ending in 01.  This mobile does not exist.  I have no mobile.   I have never had a mobile.   Heaven knows where this fictional number came from.   Year after year after year this happens, and over and over and over I tell Amazon what a nonsense it is.  But this time Amazon has inexplicably disabled my account and imposed intolerable procedures to revive it.  I am ninety-one years old.  I cannot take this stress.   Another update.   Madness follows madness.  To confirm my identity, Amazon wants me to use the scanner I do not have to send a copy of the driving licence or the passport I do not have.  Talk about piling Pelion on Ossa.                                               Or are the most recent developments the work of a scammer impersonating Amazon, trying to persuade me to use the scanner I do not have to provide a copy of the passport I do not have? Later still.  Can I believe Amazon, who now say they have reinstated my account?                                     Yet later, they have - and apologised and credited me with £50 for my trouble.   I suppose I should give  them a second star.                                                      But now I find that - two or three brief recent ones excepted - Amazon has deleted all my past reviews, including a lengthy analysis of Francois Ozon's film 'L'Amant Double'.  I take this to have been punishment for the false accusation about a seller.   Taxed with this, Amazon have the brass neck to tell me to recreate my reviews.  I kept no copies and I have better things to do.  I have taken the second star away...

11349,US,Amazon has really gone down the drain,"I used to think Amazon and their CS was awesome (at least it was years ago). Amazon claimed to deliver a package to me a day earlier than planned. I was working so I could not check for it until and hour after but there was no delivery. Looked and waited for 2 days per their recommendation. After that, I asked for the photo proof of delivery... they said they didn’t have one. So I went back and forth with them for days about what to do and talking to their logistics teams they asked me to file a police report in order to further assist. So I did. The report was completed. I called the police to confirm, they did. Amazon claims they cannot contact the police, and that they want a URL to the police report, which doesn’t exist since the city police department does not offer this.The CS team would copy and paste the same information again and again to me, it was ridiculous and made me feel like every single one of their agents was incompetent. I had offered copies, photos and contact info for the police report filed but still this was not enough, or well they couldn’t do anything with this information. I’m like why TF do you make me do all this for you and you don’t even make an effort?! I have so many regrets, I should have just gone to the store to purchase this somewhat expensive item. Now I’m at a loss here, no help, no refund. Amazon has really gone down the drain these past few years. I’m done with being a prime member.",2023,12,April,2021,3.0,1.0,low

12244,GB,Update on previous.,I just wanted to update on my previous review submitted just 30 mins ago. I have since been back on the Amazon Website and the items that I were told were out of stock are showing '10 in stock'What a joke. Is that 10 other customers that are going to pay over £1000 for items that aren't received.Another update on 17th Dec I have now been informed that my parcel will be delivered on Wednesday the 23rd Dec. This is 10 days after I made the purchase with AMAZON PRIME.... I question if my delivery date has been put back to the Wednesday as Amazon perhaps expect that they cant deliver the item but perhaps i wont chase it so close to Christmas OR by the time I know it isnt going to be delivered it is too late for me to do anything about it. Who knows. But I will of course update.Update. A very kind colleague placed the same order through her account and received delivery the following day.... Whilst I was still waiting for delivery of several repurchased items. I didn't eventually get a full refund on all of the orders placed (after Christmas) but none of them ever showed up in a delivery. I've never had a response to my email or complaint either. I will never make any big purchases through Amazon Prime again. ,2024,04,December,2020,8.0,1.0,low
17109,US,Amazon Selling Dangerous Product 12-22-2018,"I have only written two reviews in the past. I have done so to relate my experiences with companies, and I strive to stick to the facts. This is my third, and it is alarming. Today I posted a review about a defective watch that I received from a third party seller, but fulfilled by Amazon. I contacted Amazon and requested that I be allowed to return the item and that a refund be issued to me. Amazon co-operated but told me that they could not provide me with a return shipping label. That would have to come from the seller, who is in China. OH? OK. I asked how long would that take? Amazon stated that if the seller did not respond within 10 days, then Amazon would begin a claims investigation. I accepted this and gave it no further thought. Then, I took off the watch, which I had been wearing for 3 days. OH... MY... GOD! My wrist had a raw area where the watchband had been. I called the emergency room of my VA hospital and told them what was happening. They advised me to come in to have these marks examined and documented. I said I would do this tomorrow. But first, I got onto the Amazon product page, looked for my review, and couldn't find it. So I went to my Profile and there it was. Curious. So I selected ""Edit"" and tapped the ""add photo"" box and loaded from my files the photo's of the marks on my arm, which I had also loaded into my PC documents. I submitted them and waited. That was 6 hours ago. No change in my updated review ""with photo's"". Meanwhile, the ""marks"" had started to ooze a clear liquid. That FREAKED ME OUT! I called the VA hospital again and told them the new development. The attending ER physician said that most likely I was suffering from a contact chemical burn from the watch band and to come with the watch and they could have it analyzed. I haven't gone in as of yet. What I HAVE done is contact Amazon again and forcefully demand why my edited review that contained the photo's of the injury to my wrist were not posted? I am aware from experience that customer reviews are scanned by a team of the ""Communities"" section of Amazon to insure that the Community Rules and Guidelines are not ""violated"". OK. But what the hell does that have to do with me trying to raise an alarm to the buying public that Amazon is selling a dangerous product? Is my review being suppressed by Amazon in an effort to hide this and what they are selling? I gave the patient Amazon representative an earful, but he responded by assuring me that all that I had relayed to him would be delivered ASAP to his upper chain of command. He asked for my telephone number and stated that I would be contact by ""someone"" in Amazon internal investigations. Well, for now, I'm going to have to wait and see if that actually happens. I'm headed for the ER room in a few hours and I definitely will get an answer from them at least as to what in Gods name this watchband is made of and to have the wounds documented. And yes. I am contacting a legal representative of the Veterans Administration for advice as to what my rights are in regards to personal injury attained from a product sold by Amazon. If Amazon didn't like me because of my edited review, they sure as hell aren't going to once I file court papers on them. Anyway. There you have it. And like I have said in my last reviews, ""just the facts"".12/25/2018 11:43 AM PST Seattle, Washington, USAYesterday I contacted Amazon.com customer service. Asked if the they had received the 4 photos of the burn marks on my wrist. The agent acknowledge that she could see them on her monitor. I asked her what were my options. She said she would send me an e-mail with the Amazon Legal Contact information. She did send it. But it was only an address with no phone or e-mail link. The only way to contact them is through snail mail. But here is what has NOT happened. I was told that ""someone"" from Amazon would be contacting me in 6 hours. That was 12 hours ago. Maybe because of the Christmas holiday, no one is available?None the less. The Watch that caused my injuries is still listed on the Amazon web site. So.
